The speech pathologist died at the scene and a three-year-old boy was taken to the Royal Children's Hospital.

""She was the light of our lives: a cherished mother, wife, daughter and sister, and beloved by all her family and enormous network of friends,"" her family said in a statement.

""Her infectious smile, sense of humour and passion for life made her a joy to be around.

""There is an enormous hole in our hearts today.""

The family thanked emergency services and the public for laying tributes as they requested privacy.

Dozens of bunches of flowers have been placed along the kindergarten's fence by mourners, including children with tears in their eyes.

Police are yet to interview the 68-year-old driver whose tanker veered off the road and ploughed into the kindergarten.

Victorian Police Commissioner Shane Patton said the driver remained under hospital observation and would be interviewed once he was medically cleared.

Mr Patton said it was still too early to confirm whether the driver suffered a medical episode.

""We're not going to rule anything in, and we're not going to rule anything out at this stage,"" he told ABC Melbourne Radio on Tuesday.

In an emotional tribute on Tuesday, Nine's Today Show presenter Alex Cullen described his childhood friend as ""a light that lit up every room.""

""It does not surprise me one bit that Eleanor pushed those school kids out of the way yesterday to ultimately save their lives, she always, always put others first and was a great example to all of us,"" he said.

She was an accomplished speech pathologist who grew up in Coonamble in New South Wales' central west and leaves behind a husband, 11-year-old son and nine-year-old daughter.

Mr Patton described Ms Bryant as heroic after preliminary briefings indicated she moved multiple young children out of the truck's way.

""Just so brave, and the whole incident is an absolute tragedy,"" he said.

A boy hurt in the accident was treated for an arm injury, which ambulance officials said was not life-threatening.

Detective Senior Sergeant Christian Von Tunk said initial investigations indicated the truck lost control on a bridge about 120m from the pre-school.

The local basketball club said they were devastated by the loss of Ms Bryant, who was their equipment and uniform co-ordinator.

""Eleanor was the most kind, thoughtful and funny friend,"" the club's Facebook post read.

""She gave generously to her community and was committed to supporting the RCR kids to get onto the court. Most importantly, Eleanor was an amazing mum and wife.""

McKenzie Water owner Alan McKenzie confirmed the truck belonged to his company.

""Our experienced 68-year-old driver is understood to have suffered a medical episode and remains in hospital ... we are doing what we can to support him and his family,"" he said.

Macedon Ranges Shire Council CEO Bernie O'Sullivan offered his deepest condolences and vowed to support those affected.

(WSMV) – A toddler was critically injured in a hit-and-run crash on Tuesday in Nashville.

On May 28, police received a call at about 7:25 p.m. about the crash in the Highland Apartment complex parking lot at 4646 Nolensville Pike. A woman and her 2-year-old son were hit by a speeding Chrysler 300 and the driver fled the scene, according to a Metro Nashville Police Department arrest affidavit.

Responding officers found the child unconscious and sustained serious injuries, police said.

Police later spotted the vehicle on Nolensville Pike and stopped it. Police said the driver, later identified as 27-year-old Mario Alonzo, showed clear signs of impairment and was placed in custody under suspicion of DUI.

More than a dozen opened Corona beer bottles were found empty inside Alonzo’s car, according to police. At one point while police worked to get a translator on the scene, Alonzo slipped a handcuff and tried to escape, the affidavit said, and police took him back into custody.

He was so distraught after being handcuffed and too combative to read the implied consent law for officers to administer a field sobriety test. A blood sample was taken. Alonzo was charged with vehicular assault, driving without a license, resisting arrest, and an open container violation.

More charges could be pending. Alonzo remains jailed on a $77,500 bond.","Metro Nashville Police have a suspected drunk driver behind bars, accused of leaving a 2-year-old in critical condition after a hit-and-run crash.",15656,US,True,0.0,The headline mentions the toddler but does not mention the driver or the vehicle involved in the crash.,1.0,The headline refers to the toddler using human terms ('toddler').,0.0,The headline uses passive construction ('critically injured in') which obscures agency.,Driver critically injures toddler and mother in Nashville hit-and-run,"The original headline only mentioned the toddler.

Justin Fortner, 35, of Joelton, was riding the motorcycle and was killed in the crash, according to the Metro Nashville Police Department. A preliminary investigation shows a group of motorcycle riders were trying to exit onto Briley Parkway northbound and were followed by the driver of a Buick Enclave, who was reportedly acting as a buffer car.

The Buick driver told police a truck, possibly a semi, traveled around her and hit Fortner. The vehicle did not stop and continue north on Briley Parkway, police said, and a search is underway to find the driver. Fortner was thrown from the motorcycle and died at the scene, according to police.

The Buick Enclave also had front-end damage from impact with the motorcycle after the reported initial collision.

Officers are working to corroborate the Buick driver’s account.

(WSMV) - A bicyclist is fighting for his life after being run over by a car along Charlotte Avenue on Tuesday night.

Metro Nashville police said officers found the man lying in the middle of the road while out on patrol in West Nashville around midnight. He was rushed to the hospital in critical condition.

The hit-and-run crash investigation found the man was traveling westbound on Charlotte Ave. when he was struck from behind by a Nissan Titan. The bicyclist was not wearing a helmet when the crash happened just west of the 31st Avenue intersection.

James Aitcheson watches cars go up and down Charlotte Ave. while he waits for the bus. He said cars have come extremely close to hitting him multiple times while crossing the road, so he was not surprised to hear about this crash.

“People on this street don’t care,” Aitcheson said. “They speed all the time, which is a big problem. They are in a hurry to get to wherever they are going. They don’t care about pedestrians. I think more stop lights need to be put up on Charlotte, and they need to reduce the speed or at least ticket the people who speed.”

The crash happened one block west of where the dedicated bike lane ends on Charlotte Ave. at 28th Ave. and bikers are forced to share the road with cars that only have a handful of warning signs telling them to give cyclists a full lane.

Leaders with the Transit Alliance of Middle Tennessee said Mayor Freddie O’Connell’s transportation improvement program, set to be voted on as part of the November ballot, would help transform streets to make they safer for cars, pedestrians and bikers.

“That is going to make things safer, it is going to improve the economy and it is going to make it a lot easier to get from neighborhood to neighborhood walking and biking and taking transit,” Walk Bike Nashville representative Wesley Smith said.

Police said this would be the first deadly bike crash so far this year. Nine pedestrians have already been killed.

Detectives are currently working on a total of five open fatal hit-and-run cases, police said.

Aitcheson said people need to be on alert for drivers who are not paying attention to prevent more tragic crashes.

“Every time I am crossing this street it is dangerous,” Aitcheson said. “I’m just always trying to watch for where the cars are. Know how fast I can move when I am moving and try to make eye contact with the people behind the drivers’ wheels so they see that I am at least looking at them.”",A bicyclist is fighting for his life after being run over by a car along Charlotte Avenue on Tuesday night.,15560,US,True,1.0,"The headline references both the bicyclist and the vehicle involved (Nissan Titan), covering all key parties mentioned in the article.",1.0,"The headline refers to the bicyclist as a human ('bicyclist') and the vehicle as a type of car ('Nissan Titan'), but since the car is not described as a human, it does not detract from the humanization of the bicyclist.",0.0,"The headline uses passive construction with 'after being run over,' which obscures the agency of the action.",Driver of Nissan Titan critically injures bicyclist in hit-and-run crash on Charlotte Avenue in West Nashville,The original headline mentioned 'bicyclist' and 'they' (implying drivers).

""A lot of people think oh it's just a little scooter, but that scooter's turned our life upside down,"" said Bryan's father, Dean.

Dean and his wife Kim say they are living a nightmare ever since Bryan got seriously hurt in a scooter accident last Saturday.

He was on his way home on Second Street near the Nissan Stadium when they say he somehow ended up slamming into the sidewalk.

He was rushed to Vanderbilt ICU for emergency brain surgery and has been in a coma ever since.

""Until it's your own, you don't think about it. But when it's your own, he's up there fighting for his life, it's very difficult,"" said Dean.

""15 miles an hour and no helmet and hitting pavement...it can do so much damage,"" added Kim.

Both parents say they believe extra safety measures could have changed everything.

""He would say, 'I should've worn a helmet,'"" said Dean.

They say Bryan is an independent 47-year-old who loves his friends and family, his city, and his jobs at Whole Foods and Ole Smokey's.

While they hope for the best for Bryan, they hope their message of safety and awareness helps someone else.

Chazan Page, 20, of Nashville, was killed when he was struck by a either a red sedan or small sports utility vehicle, police said. Page was crossing Gallatin Pike near Marion Avenue when the incident occurred. A red car was seen leaving the scene at a high rate of speed, heading north on Gallatin Pike, police said.

The red car had significant front end damage, police said.

Page was taken to Skyline Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead, police said.

Page was an offensive lineman for Tennessee State University's football team. At 6-foot-1, 295 pounds, Page was a two-year starting offensive lineman at Tennessee State. He primarily played center and was one of only three offensive linemen who started every game in 2023.

""My thoughts and prayers are with our football student-athletes, coaches and families, and friends,"" TSU athletic director Mikki Allen said in a release. ""[Page] helped bring out the best in others with his outstanding leadership on the and off the field, positive attitude and genuine care for people around him. It is extremely difficult to lose a member of our athletics family, and we morn the loss of Chazan.""

Page had played Saturday in TSU's Blue and White Spring Game at Hale Stadium.

Page was an All-Region player at Lipscomb Academy in 2020.

""Moving to Nashville was an easy transition because of this guy and his family,"" former TSU football player Romello Tarver said in a Facebook post. ""He made me hang out with him every day and get out of my comfort zone until it became a regular thing.

""I don’t make these kinda posts when people pass away or for even my own family members… but my boy Chazan Page was truly my homie. Whenever I was down he knew how to make me laugh and bring me right back to where I needed to be… them hard days in fall camp was always a fun moment cus he would find something to joke about. In the summer he would make get the studio once a week whether I was rapping or just being there with him and the rest of the 'Big Dawg' crew. I’m just happy I always told you I loved you broski! Fly high.""

Lipscomb Academy coach Jamie Graham posted on X that he could find the right words:

""Please pray for the Page family,"" Graham wrote. ""We will miss you Chazan.""

Former Super Bowl quarterback and now University of Alabama at Birmingham head football coach Trent Dilfer posted on X asking the public to help find the hit-and-run driver.

""RIP Chazan,"" Dilfer wrote. ""Prayers for the Page family.""

(WTVF) — A Memphis man is facing multiple felony charges after Metro Police say he crashed into someone on a Lime scooter.

Randolph Allen Ford is charged with felony vehicular assault and felony reckless endangerment. He is being held on a $15,000 bond.

Leonard John Patrick Roecker, 23, of Wisconsin, was operating the scooter. Now, he is fighting for his life at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.

The collision happened Saturday night on 4th Avenue South near Elm Street.

According to a Metro Police officer at the scene, Roecker was on a Lime scooter and pulling out of a nearby music venue when the pickup truck — which was speeding according to a witness — came up from behind and struck the scooter. The pickup truck then traveled off the left side of the roadway and crossed over a sidewalk before striking a utility pole and railroad ties in a parking lot. Ford was not wearing a seat belt and struck his head when his vehicle hit the pole.

""The scooter was in pieces. The truck had obviously barreled across and hit the pole across the street,"" said Tony Block, owner of Bar: Cigar Especial.

At this intersection, in the last four months, there's been six crashes, according to police data. Last year, a car struck Block's business, hit the water line and caused a flood.

""Something has to be done. It really is a dangerous street,"" Block said.

Brian Hardson catches the bus at the intersection. He thinks more stop signs would help. Right now, you can drive four blocks from Korean Veterans Blvd to Lafayette Street without having to stop.

""Broadway is busy, so everyone is coming out of Broadway — Nashville is a booming town and Broadway is the heart of it. Most people leaving Broadway leave to come out this way,"" said Hardson.

Police think alcohol may have played a part in Ford's actions. He was transported to Vanderbilt, where a blood sample was taken to be tested for drugs and alcohol.

Brumley, a 30-year-old father of two, lost his life in a hit-and-run incident on Nolensville Pike, one of the city's busiest and notoriously dangerous streets.

The incident unfolded when Brumley, an avid runner, was struck and killed by a white Dodge Challenger while jogging along Nolensville Pike and McClain Avenue. The driver never stopped.
 
Patterson, overwhelmed with grief, is not only mourning the untimely loss of her son, but also advocating for justice in his case. She shares her feelings in the player above, holding back tears.

The police are seeking to question 19-year-old Jefry Francisco Rubi Orellana in connection with the hit-and-run, and the family is urging him to come forward and cooperate with authorities.

Anyone with information on Orellana is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 615-742-7463.

“I know he must be scared. We just want justice,” pleaded Patterson.

The family is also calling for increased safety measures along Nolensville Pike, a a road that sees over 26,000 vehicles daily.

According to the Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT), there have been 816 reported crashes along this corridor since 2014, with 68 involving pedestrians or bicyclists. Tragically, 59 of these incidents resulted in fatalities or serious injuries, with 40% involving pedestrians or individuals using wheelchairs.

To address the concerning safety record, the family is hopeful that something positive can emerge from the tragedy.

With $13 million in federal grant funding allocated for improvements, Nolensville Pike is set to undergo significant upgrades from McCall Street to Haywood Lane.

These will include, but are not limited to the following:

    building safe sidewalk connections where they are currently missing
    and/or are in need of repair
    constructing additional street lighting and pedestrian-scale lighting to improve visibility during dark and low-light conditions;
    constructing safer intersections and crossings, including adding high visibility crosswalks, adding pedestrian hybrid beacons at strategic locations, adjusting signal timings to include leading pedestrian intervals, and constructing bulb-out intersection features
    enhancing bus stop designs to ensure safe access

Patterson expressed her hope that these improvements would prevent future tragedies.
“If this helps get the roads fixed or the lighting or whatever it is that they need and saves one person's life, I would be grateful and very happy,” she said.

While the start date for the construction on Nolensville Pike is yet to be announced, the city of Nashville has already approved $3.2 million in local funds for the project.","Kimberly Patterson, is pushing for both justice and enhanced safety measures after her son, Dustin Brumley, became a victim in a fatal pedestrian crash.",14650,US,True,0.0,The headline mentions the family and the victim but does not mention the driver or the vehicle involved in the crash.,1.0,The headline refers to the parties involved using human terms: 'family' and 'loved one.',0.0,"The headline does not use active voice to describe the crash.

Five vehicles were involved in the crash, including a Pioneer Trails charter bus that was transporting students from the Tuscarawas Valley local school district in eastern Ohio, said Sean Grady, Licking county emergency management agency director. There were a total of 57 people onboard, he said.

Lt Nathan Dennis of the Ohio State Highway Patrol confirmed that people were killed in the crash and said “18 people were taken from the bus (overall),” including 15 children, but he declined to specify how many deaths had occurred and declined further comment since authorities were still notifying the victims’ families.

The bus was carrying Tuscarawas Valley students and chaperones to an Ohio School Boards Association conference in Columbus, said Derek Varansky, the superintendent.

“Right now, our focus is on getting in touch with our Tusky Valley families who had loved ones on the bus and providing support to our entire school community,” Varansky said in a Facebook post.

The conference was canceled after organizers learned of the crash.

“Given this devastating news, we have canceled our conference. Right now, our focus is on providing support to Tuscarawas Valley. That includes making grief counselors from our trade show available,” said Jeff Chambers, the association’s director of communication services.

The accident occurred shortly before 9am on Interstate 70 West in Licking county, near the Smoke Road underpass and about 26 miles (42km) east of Columbus. The cause was not immediately known.

The injured were being treated at seven hospitals.

In a statement, Pioneer Trails, the charter bus company, confirmed there was an incident involving one of its buses Tuesday morning.

“Pioneer is fully cooperating with the authorities as we work to find the cause of the accident,” the company’s statement said. “Our thoughts and prayers go out to all of those impacted by this accident. As this is an ongoing investigation, there will be no further comments.”

The American Red Cross of Central and Southern Ohio said it fulfilled a request for more blood from one hospital in the area, sending 30 units to a hospital in the Mount Carmel Health System, said Marita Salkowski, regional communications director. A center was set up at a United Methodist Church in Etna for bus passengers not in need of medical attention to go to and contact loved ones, she said.

Numerous emergency responders were at the scene, and Ohio Department of Transportation cameras from the area showed smoke coming from the crash site. Police officers were blocking the entrance ramps to I-70 East and West near the scene of the accident, increasing traffic along the road leading to the interstate. Dozens of emergency response vehicles were still at the scene of the accident several hours after it occurred.

Mickey Lymon, an investigator with the Licking county coroner’s office, said they had been called to the scene, but deferred other questions to the state police.

“This is our worst nightmare, when we have a bus full of children involved in a crash,” said Ohio’s governor, Mike DeWine, during a news conference at the scene. “Prayers go out to the families, everyone who was on the bus.”

It was the second recent fatal crash involving high school students on a charter bus. In September, two people were killed and several others injured when a charter bus carrying high school students to band camp veered off a New York highway.","Five vehicles were involved in the crash and 15 people were injured, and officials said the cause was not immediately known",14510,US,True,1.0,The headline references all key parties involved in the crash: the semi-truck and the bus carrying students.,0.0,"The headline refers to the bus and the semi-truck as vehicles rather than the humans involved (e.g., 'driver,' 'students').",1.0,The headline uses active voice to describe the crash ('semi-truck hits bus').,"Semi-truck driver rear-ends bus carrying Tuscarawas Valley students, killing three and injuring 15","The original headline mentioned the semi-truck and the bus, but the rewritten headline explicitly mentions the semi-truck driver and the Tuscarawas Valley students to ensure all parties involved are clear.","The original headline used 'semi-truck' and 'bus,' which are transportation modes.

The crash occurred near the intersection of West End Avenue and Murphy Road at 6:04 p.m.

A portion of West End Avenue was closed while the Crash Investigation Team investigated.

A preliminary investigation shows the motorcyclist appeared to run a red light at Murphy Road, just prior to the crash, police said. The motorcyclist carried a Mexican identification card, according to police, so the Medical Examiner’s Office will work to confirm his identity.

“Witnesses reported the motorcycle was traveling west on West End Avenue at a high rate of speed when it ran the red light,” the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department said in a media release. “A GMC Yukon, traveling east on West End Avenue, was stopped near the intersection of Murphy Road to turn left into the Exxon parking lot. The driver of the Yukon said he waited for the traffic light to turn red for oncoming traffic before initiating the turn. The motorcycle collided with the right rear quarter panel of the SUV.”

The driver of the Yukon, Ledarryll Amos, 40, ran away on foot from the Exxon parking lot, police said.

Five people – including two children – who were killed after a car crashed into the beer garden of a pub in Daylesford in rural Victoria were members of two “family groups” who were visiting the area, police say.

Just after 6pm on Sunday, a white BMW SUV mounted the kerb and hit patrons on the front lawn of the Royal Daylesford hotel, police said.

The Victorian chief police commissioner, Shane Patton, on Monday said four victims died at the scene. The victims include two men, believed to be aged in their 30s, a woman believed to be aged in her 40s, and a boy.

A female child, reportedly a teenager, was flown to the Alfred hospital in Melbourne where she later died on Sunday evening.

“There were, in essence, two … different family groups that were known to each other who were significantly involved and impacted by this,” Patton said.

The victims are yet to be formally identified.

Five people were taken to hospital with a range of injuries, including a boy, believed to be aged 6, who is in a stable condition at the Royal Children’s hospital. Police said a 35-year-old woman is in a serious condition in the intensive care unit at the Royal Melbourne hospital.

A 43-year-old woman and a 38-year-old man, flown to Royal Melbourne hospital, are understood to be stable, Patton said. An 11-month-old baby was flown to Ballarat Base hospital and is also in a stable condition.

Patton said the families were “visitors just going about their everyday life, just enjoying themselves on a beautiful Sunday afternoon”.

“It is an absolute tragedy,” he said.

The driver of the BMW, a 66-year-old man from Mount Macedon, was taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.

The driver was breath tested and did not have alcohol in his system, Patton said. The driver’s blood tests will also be analysed.

Police from the major collision investigation unit are expected to interview the man on Monday afternoon.

Patton said it was too early to determine if speed was a factor in the fatal crash.

He paid tribute to the first responders on the scene, saying they would carry the scene with them for “many years”.

“It may haunt them forever,” he said.

“It’s one of the most confronting scenes, I’ve been told, that experienced officers have been to.”

The Victoria Ambulance’s regional director, Trevor Weston, told Nine’s Today show emergency crews had been confronted with “an extremely chaotic scene”.

He said members of the public had done a “fantastic job” to help the injured until ambulance paramedics arrived. “We had about seven ambulances and four ambulance helicopters dispatched and conveyed those patients off to hospital,” Weston said.

He told reporters that the injuries were “quite traumatic for a number of those patients”.

Daylesford was a close-knit community, he said, and some of the initial crews were from the area. “You never want to respond to any incident like this but certainly not in your home town,” Weston said.

The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, thanked those who helped victims – including emergency services workers – at the scene of the “horrific” crash.

“My thoughts are with all those injured, and with the friends and family of those who have tragically died,” Allan said on X, formerly known as Twitter, on Monday morning.

The Hepburn shire mayor, Brian Hood, said Daylesford would have been crowded on Sunday, with many people enjoying the warm evening over the unofficial Melbourne Cup long weekend. “This will send shock waves through the community for some time,” he told ABC TV.

The federal infrastructure minister, Catherine King, whose Ballarat electorate includes Daylesford, asked the community to follow advice from emergency services as crews carry out their work.

But when a car mounted a kerb and drove into the busy beer garden of the Royal Daylesford Hotel, the joyous spring-time setting turned to tragedy.

Five people, including two children, were killed.

They included a 38-year-old man and his 11-year-old son, and a 44-year-old woman and her 30-year-old male partner, along with the woman's nine-year-old daughter.

At the scene on Monday morning, full jugs, stacks of cups and sunglasses remained untouched on picnic tables where diners had been enjoying the day.

A dog bowl lay on one section of a damaged bench and a shoe could be seen lying on the grass behind police tape as investigators in hazmat suits combed through debris.

Police say the driver, a 66-year-old Macedon man, returned a zero blood-alcohol reading and is expected to be interviewed on Tuesday.

Local businessman Mark Ward was in tears as he sat and watched residents lay tributes at the scene.

""Our community is enormously tight-knit — we are so proud of our town,"" Mr Ward said.

""For this to happen in such a drastic way, it's devastating for everyone.""

Mr Ward said he had offered his staff the day off to take time to process and grieve.

""A lot of our locals are struggling to cope,"" he said.

""In fact, I'm struggling to cope.""

Known for its mineral springs, spas and regional cuisine, the town swells with tourists during holiday periods.

Assistant Commissioner for Road Policing Glenn Weir told the ABC that all of those who died were tourists who had travelled to Daylesford from Melbourne.

""It should have been, and it was, a great day, the weather was perfect,"" he said.

""It should have been a great day and it's ended in absolute tragedy for those who have obviously lost their lives, their family, the injured, but broadly the community of Daylesford, which is one of the great tourism and lifestyle destinations in Victoria.

""It's just absolutely heartbreaking.""

'Amplifies the impact'
Established in 1916, the Royal Daylesford Hotel is one of the town's oldest and most popular pubs.

It is situated next to a busy roundabout at the intersection of the town's main streets.

Victoria Police Chief commissioner Shane Patton said the coroner might look into the safety of the grassy outdoor dining area used by the hotel as part of the investigation into the incident.

""It's right in the middle of town,"" Hepburn Shire Mayor Brian Hood said.

""That in itself amplifies the impact.

""Everyone knows the pub, they know the outdoor dining area."" 

Longtime local Joanna Parker said she was on her way to get groceries when she saw the shocking scene on Sunday night.

""There were lots of locals that were crying,"" she said.

""All the girls from the shops that work at the restaurants said, 'We will have to close.'

Chief Commissioner Patton said people raced to help.

""There were numerous people there who selflessly came out and aided those who were dying, who needed first aid,"" he said.

Rob Green and Michelle Gray were visiting Daylesford for the weekend and considered stopping at the hotel for a drink, but decided against it.

""We saw them sitting out the front at about 3pm … about 60 people,"" Mr Green said.

""We thought, 'Oh it would be a nice place to stop for a beer.

""It's horrible — it must be awful for the local community.""

Hepburn Shire Deputy Mayor Lesley Hewitt, who lives near the hotel, said there had been a huge outpouring of support.

""My phone has been ringing off the hook, but not just from locals — from people all over the country checking what's going on,"" she said.

""It is a tough time and people will need support, and people will need the opportunity to come together and reflect on this, on the loss, on how this could happen.""

'Destroyed in an instant'
Local musician Anthony Rodgers said he had planned to play outside the pub on Sunday night.

""I hadn't been out because of the COVID thing … and I thought I'll come out and have a sing and I was going to set up near the statue on the grass, sing a few songs, and I got to cutting the grass way late and I didn't come up,"" he said.

""But if I had I would have been standing there, and it's just shocked me.""

Mary Chase had travelled to Daylesford for a wedding and was in the hotel with friends waiting to have dinner when the crash occurred.

""We were all taken to the back of the pub and evacuated, and we were taken out, and we already saw white sheets,"" she said.

""So they were already covering up people.""

Ms Chase said it took a few minutes for the gravity of the situation to register.

""More and more police were coming, and then helicopters and then yeah — we started to realise how bad it was,"" she said.

""We literally walked through that beer garden five minutes before.""

Melbourne residents Jenna Acquarola and James Deriu said they were sitting at the crash site an hour before the incident.

""It was a beautiful night,"" Ms Acquarola said.

""The sun was going down, everyone was enjoying the sun, and it was destroyed in an instant.

""It is so sad for Daylesford — I don't think it will be the same.""

Chief Commissioner Shane Patton said the incident may ""haunt"" those involved ""forever"".

""I've spoken to the head of … road policing [in the area] who was at the scene and he described it as one of the worst and most confronting that he had ever been to, and he has been to many,"" Chief Commissioner Patton said.

""Many people will now be questioning the fragility of life.""

A community vigil was held at Victoria Park in Daylesford on Monday night, with hundreds turning up to show their support.

Emergency services were called to the scene on Maxwells Avenue, Ashcroft, about 10:50am on Monday, where a grey Ford sedan crashed into a tree and a power pole.

The vehicle split in two and came to rest in the front yard of a house.

The two boys, who were rear passengers in the car, died at the scene. They are yet to be formally identified.

It is alleged the driver and the front-seat passenger — believed to be ""young males"" — fled the crash scene.

CCTV footage obtained by the ABC shows the moment of the crash before one person emerged from the driver's seat of the vehicle wreckage.

The person appears to walk across the front lawn to briefly inspect the scene before fleeing.

Police Assistant Commissioner Brett McFadden, from the state's traffic and highway patrol, said the bystanders witnessed ""absolute destruction"" and ""carnage"".

""Anyone that would have witnessed that crash would no doubt be traumatised by it,"" he said.

Police believe the car was travelling north on Maxwells Avenue ""well above"" the 50 kilometre per hour speed limit.

Police also want to speak to the rider of a trail bike which was seen travelling on the street at the same time as the crash.

CCTV footage from the scene shows the bike riding on to the grass moments after the crash.

Assistant Commissioner McFadden said it was unclear what, if any, role the bike may have played in the incident but that it was an ""active line of investigation"".

Search for those who fled scene
Police dogs have been used to scour the bushland near Cabramatta Creek at Magee Street and Maxwells Avenue in the search for those who left the scene.

The assistant commissioner said inquiries into how the crash occurred and the state of the remaining occupants of the car are ongoing.

""They just need to present themselves to a police station so we can engage with them and they can assist us with the inquiries and work out how this tragic situation unfolded,"" he said.

""The driver is ultimately responsible for themselves, the passengers and the others on the road.""

A crime scene was established and the road cordoned off.

The scene will be forensically examined by the crash investigation unit.

Assistant commissioner McFadden said speeding was a ""selfish"" act that had played a large role in more than 100 deaths this year.

""The community should be outraged and the wider community should take stock that this is a result of speeding,"" he said.

""This represents 300 lives lost on our roads so far this year … and our estimate is around 40 to 50 per cent of those lives lost, speed is a direct contributing factor.""","Two boys aged between 10 and 15 years old die in a car crash in Sydney's south-west, with police searching for another two people who allegedly fled the scene.",14484,AU,True,0.0,"The headline mentions the boys who died and the people who allegedly left the scene, but it does not mention the driver and the front-seat passenger who fled the scene explicitly as humans.",0.0,"The headline refers to the boys who died as 'boys,' which is a human term, but it does not explicitly describe the driver and the front-seat passenger as humans.

The boys died after being thrown from a car which crashed on a suburban street at Ashcroft, in Sydney’s southwest, about 10.50am on Monday.

They are yet to be formally identified but police have confirmed they were aged 13 and 14.

About 12.30pm on Tuesday, two men were arrested at Wetherill Park police station, police said.

The men, aged 23 and 27, were taken to Liverpool hospital under police guard for assessment and injuries allegedly sustained in the crash.

Police say they also want to speak to the unknown person caught on CCTV circling the wreckage on a trail bike almost immediately after the crash, which split the car in two.

The crash happened on a street with a 50 km/h speed limit.

“The community should be outraged and the wider community should take stock that this is a direct result of speeding,” the assistant commissioner of NSW Police, Brett McFadden, said on Monday.

“The more we condone it and we engage in it, the more this is going to take place.”

The front half of the car ended up next to a jacaranda tree while the boot was strewn in the front yard of a home.

Emergency services were called to the intersection of Church Street and Appin Road in Appin last Wednesday following reports of a crash.

On arrival, police were told the teenager had been hit by a truck after getting off a bus.

He was treated at the scene and taken to Westmead Children's Hospital, but police have confirmed he has now died from his injuries.

The 38-year-old male truck driver was uninjured and underwent mandatory testing.

Police established a crime scene and are continuing their investigations into the crash.

Community devastated
Local Deputy Mayor Matthew Deeth said the community of Appin was devastated.

""The news of [his] passing has completely rocked the community out there,"" he said.

""When you lose one of your own it really dramatically impacts everyone. We're certainly all feeling it today.""

Wollondilly MP Judy Hannan agreed everyone had been impacted by the tragedy.

""It's been really horrific news,"" she said.

""There's ongoing police investigations and it is all about Appin Road.""

Notorious road
Appin Road is a busy state road that carries thousands of vehicles each day, including freight trucks, and passes directly through villages such as Appin and Campbelltown.

Ms Hannan said over the past 20 years more than 30 people had lost their lives on the stretch of road.

""It is a road that everybody that knows it, knows how many cars and trucks go up and down,"" she said.

""We have made numerous representations over the years to try and have something done about it.""

Longstanding issue
Michelle Marion is part of the Appin Development community group and, following the accident, said the community had been pushing for safer pedestrian crossings for years.

""I think it's about time the state government actually come to the table with residents,"" she said.

""Appin Road has been an issue for over 40 years. What happened with this little boy should be enough for them to take notice.""

Ms Hannan said with major growth areas flagged in the region, traffic would increase along the busy road.

""We are really concerned going forward about the fact that we are going to have increased population along the road, we are going to have a park on one side of the road,"" she said.

Joshua Pike was hit by a truck on Appin Road, Appin, last week when he was crossing the road after getting off the school bus.

Joshua was excited to get home and play with his dog, Xena, and did not see the oncoming truck.

He died five days later in Westmead Hospital.

""It's sent a shock wave through the community,"" close family friend Jackie Austin said.

""Not just the passing of someone, but the passing of someone so young — it's so tragic.""

She said Joshua was being remembered as energetic, popular and as a loving brother to his siblings, including his baby sister.

""He could make you laugh at the drop of a hat,"" Ms Austin said.

""Just a fun-loving kid — loved his family, absolutely loved them, and a larger-than-life character.""

Campbelltown MP Greg Warren said the whole community was affected.

""This is nothing short of a tragedy,"" he said.

""I can't begin to imagine how Joshua's family and friends are feeling.""

'Heroic' fight for life
Ms Austin said Josh's family made the decision to use his death to help save lives.

""He should have passed away on impact that's how severe his injuries were, but he managed to hang on for five days — enough to fight for his organs to be donated,"" she said.

""The way he's gone is heroic they can't believe he hung on for as long as he did.""

Ms Austin said his mother, Leah Pike, was sure Josh would have been proud of being able to help others.

""She kept saying, 'This is exactly what Josh would have wanted,'"" Ms Austin said.

""He's spreading love everywhere and saving lives, and that's what he was about.""

'Hold your kids tight'
An online fundraiser set up for funeral costs has attracted almost $50,000 in donations.

Friends have set up a small memorial at the crash site, near Josh's home, and at Ambarvale High School, where Josh was in year 7.

Ms Austin said the family's main message was to parents and siblings.

""Hold your kids tight, tell your kids you love them every day, siblings tell each other you love them every day,"" she said.

""Don't take life for granted.""

The family has shared several photos of Josh, but Ms Austin said they were ""horrified"" by the publication of footage and images of the moment he was hit by the truck.

""It's extremely disrespectful,"" she said.

""It's hard, because the family has seen it — you can imagine?""

Push for safe crossing
Joshua's death has sparked calls for safety improvements on the single-lane Appin Road, a single-lane road that runs through villages south of Sydney and is frequently used by heavy freight.

Ms Austin said Appin lacked safe road crossings.

""Where the accident happened there's nothing — literally nothing,"" she said.

""There's no pedestrian crossing, no slow-down, the limit is 50 kilometres an hour.""

Mr Warren said he would advocate for ""a safety review of both vehicular and pedestrian movement in and around Appin"".

""Ultimately what we need is a pedestrian crossing and that is going to be a focus for me,"" he said.","Joshua Pike's family and friends are remembering the 13-year-old as a fun-loving, larger-than-life character who could ""make you laugh at the drop of a hat"".",14486,AU,True,1.0,"The headline references both the teenager (Joshua Pike) and the truck, which are the key parties involved in the crash.",1.0,"The headline refers to the teenager as 'Teen' and the truck as 'truck,' but since the truck is not described as a human, this is acceptable as it is not the primary focus.

Juliet woman hit, killed by pickup truck while riding bike on Highway 100","NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WKRN) – A 23-year-old woman died Friday evening after being struck by a pickup truck while riding her bike on Highway 100. 

The Metro Nashville Police Department said the crash happened at approximately 6:45 p.m. on Highway 100 near Harpeth Trace Drive on Friday, Sept. 8. 

A preliminary investigation shows that 23-year-old Alyssa Milligan of Mt. Juliet, was riding with another cyclist on Highway 100 when she was struck by a Ford F-150 pickup truck. 

Authorities reported Milligan was hit by the passenger side of the pickup truck and thrown off her bike. She was taken to Vanderbilt University Medical Center, where she was pronounced dead. 

According to police, the 46-year-old driver of the pickup truck told officers that he saw a cyclist ahead of him on the right side of the roadway. He claimed that as he was attempting to change lanes, he looked over his shoulder, and the cyclist was suddenly in front of him.  

Officials said it appears that the pickup truck failed to yield to the right of way to Milligan. The pickup truck driver reportedly showed no signs of impairment at the scene. 

Authorities said charges are possible pending the conclusion of the investigation into the deadly collision, which remains ongoing.

Three cars, a black Mercedes SUV, a Toyota Echo and a Toyota Rav4, were involved in the incident that occurred on Sadleir Avenue in Heckenberg, near Liverpool, just before 9.30pm.

Police believe ""high speed"" was a contributing factor and are investigating a person of interest after the occupants of the Mercedes allegedly fled in what's being described as ""abhorrent behaviour"".

Paramedics treated 24-year-old Alina Kauffman and her 15-year-old brother, Ernesto Salazer, at the scene but they weren't able to be revived.

The pair were driving home after the sister picked up her brother from his new job and were just metres away from their house when their car was struck.

About 2pm on Saturday, a 20-year-old man was arrested after he went to Liverpool Police Station. 

The man, who was driving with a disqualified licence, has been charged and will appear before Parramatta Bail Court on Sunday.

He was charged with a number of offences including two counts of dangerous driving occasioning death.

Angelina Kauffman, the mother of two siblings, spoke to media on Saturday about her devastating loss.

""My daughter she's such a beautiful girl, she loves her brother,"" Ms Kauffman said.

""And my son he loves his sister. Now my son is gone and my daughter she's gone. My kids are gone and I have to live the rest of my life with no kids, why? I don't understand.""

According to police, the Mercedes collided head-on with the Toyota Echo occupied by the siblings, before slamming into a stationary Toyota and flipping on its side.

They allege three occupants managed to get out of the rolled car and escaped in another vehicle, a Volkswagen Golf.

""The evidence at this stage suggest the Mercedes crossed to the incorrect side of the road attempting to overtake a car in front of it and has collided head-on with the Toyota Echo,"" Acting Assistant Commissioner Anthony Boyd said.

""I think it's abhorrent behaviour. I think the nature of the collision itself is totally unacceptable behaviour.

""And then to flee the scene and not offer assistance to the people in a vehicle, you may have been able to provide some form of first aid which may have assisted in saving their lives.""

He said the car had been reported as stolen but its status was under investigation.

Police are also trying to confirm the relationship between the VW Golf and the Mercedes.

Late on Friday, the VW's 18-year-old driver attended Liverpool Police Station where he was arrested. He has since being released without being charged.

Neighbours, including Parisa Mesri, rushed to the scene to offer assistance after hearing a ""loud sound"".

""I came out and see that two cars had accident together and people that were inside the small car we tried to help them,"" Ms Mesri said.

""But we couldn't do anything because it was very bad. Other neighbours tried to help the boy before the ambulance came.""

She said she saw a number of people jump out of a car and assumed they were going to help the victims but ""they ran away"".

Police said officers attempted to make a traffic stop on a vehicle in the early morning hours on Tuesday which was after juvenile curfew on Lafayette Street near Fairfield Avenue.

The vehicle was traveling at an extremely high rate of speed and officers began pursuing it, according to the affidavit. Shortly after the pursuit began, the car crashed head-on into a utility pole and officers observed six people running from it towards Lewis Street.

The vehicle became engulfed in flames.

Five of the occupants, who were all under the age of 18, went home and called 911 to report the car crash, police said. Officers found one of the juvenile victims was seriously injured to the point of possible permanent disfigurement in the face.

Three other victims were taken to Monroe Carell Jr. Children’s Hospital at Vanderbilt for injuries they sustained in the crash, according to the affidavit. All five of the juvenile victims told officers the driver and owner of the vehicle, and told him to slow down.

Some of the victims told police that 19-year-old Malachi Byrd ran away after they called the police to help them with their injuries, police said.

Later on Tuesday, Byrd flagged down an officer on Murfreesboro Pike and asked if he could get his belongings from the crashed vehicle, according to the affidavit. Officers then took him into custody.

(WSMV) - A motorcyclist died after a hit-and-run in Madison late Thursday night, according to the Metro Nashville Police Department.

A preliminary investigation indicates Jaxon Leasure, 17, was traveling south on Gallatin Pike on his Kawasaki Ninja in the center turn lane at a high rate of speed when a dark-colored GMC SUV was pulling out of 105 Gallatin Pike N. making a left turn, according to police.

The two vehicles crashed and Leasure was thrown from the motorcycle, and he hit a sign, police said. Leasure was taken to Vanderbilt University Medical Center, where he died, according to MNPD.

“We heard the first bang, and we looked over and saw the motorcycle going across the road,” witness Rene Laizer said. “We thought he was passing but in reality whatever he hit sent him on his trajectory over there to that sign.”

Laizer ran from the gas station where he was parked to check on Leasure, but said the teen was unresponsive and not moving. When medics arrived on scene, he said they did CPR before taking him to the hospital.

It’s believed the dark-colored SUV initially stopped but left the scene prior to officers arriving, police said. Toxicology testing will be conducted to determine if impairment was a factor in the crash.

A tribute left at the scene

The child died at the scene after being hit by a car whilst out cycling
West Midlands Ambulance Service said a pedestrian who had also been hit by a car near the scene was taken to the Heartlands Hospital with minor injuries.

The death is the third involving a cyclist in Birmingham in as many weeks and the area's cycling commissioner has called for urgent safety improvements.

Mohammed, who is from the area, told BBC News a pedestrian was struck by a vehicle as he ran to help the 12-year-old and was taken away in an ambulance. He said people did not feel safe on the streets.

""He was trying to show his support and go help him,"" he said.

""As a result of that he has been injured as well.""

Mohammed

Mohammed said a pedestrian was struck by a vehicle as he went to help the boy
He said there had been a few recent incidents with vehicles and pedestrians on the road.

A pedestrian narrowly avoided being struck by a car that went on to into a fence on the same stretch on Tuesday.

""He lost control of the car and hit the fence,"" Mohammed said.

""It just shows as a community, me, myself as a 16-year-old you don't feel safe walking around these streets any more..""

West Midlands Cycling Commissioner Adam Tranter, who was appointed in 2021, has called for tougher policing and extra road safety measures from Birmingham City Council after a spate of fatal crashes involving bikes.

'Grim statistics'
Speaking before the latest death, he said collisions happened ""with such a regularity that you could be fooled into thinking that this is normal"".

""My message is that this is not normal,"" Mr Tranter said.

The Better Streets for Birmingham group also called for improved safety in a letter published on Twitter on Friday.

It tweeted: ""The killing of a child cyclist now puts the grim statistics in our letter out of date. The situation is untenable.""

In its letter, the group criticised what it described as a ""delay"" in delivering road safety measures.

It has also invited people to a vigil on Saturday, at the junction of Belgrave Middleway and Horton Square, where a cyclist died on 16 May.

Metro officers responded to the crash just before 2 a.m. Hicks was taken to Vanderbilt Medical Center, where she died.

Police said the driver of the Tundra, 44-year-old Montrell Phillips, showed obvious signs of impairment at the scene. He was extremely unsteady on his feet and failed field sobriety tests.

Phillips was charged with DUI, no proof of insurance, and driving on a revoked license.

Toxicology tests are pending on both drivers. Neither was wearing a seatbelt.

(WSMV) – A young teenager involved in a crash with eight of his family members in Springfield on Friday has died.

Metro Nashville Police Department said Wednesday morning its crash investigation unit had been informed that 13-year-old Gabriel Barrera Jr. had succumbed to his injuries.

Barrera Jr. and eight of his family members were hurt in a two-car rollover accident at the intersection of Springfield Highway and Baker Station Road around 10:30 p.m. Friday. Officers responded to a crash and discovered a Toyota Highlander upside down. A preliminary report shows the driver of the Toyota was traveling south on Springfield Highway when it was hit by another driver who allegedly ran a stop sign.

The crash sent the Toyota into a roll, ejecting Barrera and other occupants until the vehicle stopped and landed upside down. The driver of the Nissan Murano that hit the family’s Toyota Highlander got out and ran away, according to police.

Barrera’s family told WSMV4 the 13-year-old had suffered a brain injury during the crash. Barrera was supposed to graduate from Innovation Academy on Tuesday and try out for the Springfield High School soccer team in the coming weeks.

Metro Police said they found evidence of both alcohol and drug involvement inside the abandoned Nissan Murano. They are still looking for the suspect but said they have strong leads.

Anyone with information about the hit-and-run driver is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 615-742-7463.

Bryant Freedle, 28, died after a person driving an 18-wheeler drove over him and his pickup truck, The Tennessee Highway Patrol (THP) reported. THP added that two people may be facing charges.

According to troopers, all five vehicles were driving north on Interstate 65 between Cross Plains and the Kentucky state line on Tuesday around 2 p.m.

Freedle was stopped behind two 18-wheelers when 71-year-old David Arnold, who was driving an 18-wheeler, was beginning to slow down. All of a sudden 55-year-old Davina Luckett, also driving an 18-wheeler, rear-ended Arnold.

The impact of the rear-end caused Arnold to rear-end and drive over Freedle’s pickup truck.

Freedle’s pickup truck then hit the 18-wheeler in front of him, which caused the 18-wheeler to rear-end another 18-wheeler.

In addition to Freedle’s death, Luckett was also injured. According to Smokey Barn News, Luckett was taken to a local hospital with minor injuries.

“When I found out about it, I thought maybe he was dead,” Darinel’s brother, Jorge Ruiz, said through a translator. “They told me I had decisions to make, and to me, that’s what I thought. It made it really hard.”

Crash on I-65 leaves man critically injured in Franklin

Jorge said the past three weeks have been nearly impossible. He moved to Middle Tennessee just eight months ago to live with his brother and try to support their family back in Mexico. He’s now having to support them while also paying all their bills here on his own.

“It’s very hard for me financially and also stressful mentally for me because it’s tough,” Jorge said through the translator. “It’s tough for one person.”

Darinel has gone through multiple surgeries, including one to replace five vertebras in his neck, Jorge said. He was on a ventilator and could not move from the chest down.

Jorge drives from their home in Columbia to Nashville every day to visit Darinel at Vanderbilt Hospital.

“He is still not doing well,” Jorge said through the translator. “He is in intensive care. We don’t know when he is going to be out. He is getting better day by day.”

Family friend Tina Mota has been helping Jorge through this tragic situation. She said they feel helpless and are always concerned they are going to get a call from the hospital saying Darinel has made a turn for the worse.

Fundraiser started to help Ruiz family

“Just seeing him laying there, it’s heart-wrenching,” Mota said. “It’s heartbreaking and it makes me want to push forward to help the family as much as I can.”

Tina started a GoFundMe to help cover the medical costs and help Jorge travel to and from the hospital to visit Darinel. They are also looking to find a new handicap-accessible house for them to live in and finally bring Darinel home to be with his family.

“He can’t move from his chest down, but his arms will just start shaking,” Mota said. “It’s where he is trying to lift his lower body that he doesn’t feel, and he doesn’t realize. He thinks he is moving it, or he is trying to sit up, and he is not. It’s just hard. It’s terrible.”",Darinel Ruiz paralyzed from the chest down when police said his car broke down and someone crashed into it.,13393,US,True,0.0,"The headline mentions 'man,' but it does not reference the other driver involved in the crash.",1.0,"The headline refers to the involved party as 'man,' which is a human term.",0.0,"The headline uses a passive construction with 'fighting for his life,' which does not clearly show who performed the action leading to the crash.",Driver critically injures man after crashing into his broken-down car on I-65,The original headline only mentioned 'a man.'

(WTVF) — A 50-year-old woman is dead Wednesday morning after a hit-and-run crash while walking her dog in the 200 block of Rio Vista Drive.

Early investigations show that the woman may have been visually impaired. The woman was walking with her dog around 6:30 a.m. on the east side of Rio Vista Drive over a bridge when she was hit.

A passerby found the woman in the roadway. The woman was transported to Skyline Medical Center where she was later pronounced dead. Officials say that the woman lived in an apartment complex near the scene.

Police located the woman's uninjured dog sitting at the front door of the apartment. They believe the pup walked home on its own after the crash. He was taken to Metro Animal Care and Control and appears to be OK.

Metro Nashville Police Department officials said they are searching for the suspect who was potentially driving a Ford F-150 pickup truck. Officers at the scene found chrome grill parts belonging to a 2009 to 2014 F-150 in the roadway near the scene.

No witnesses have come forward after the incident. Police are working to notify the woman's family, so her identity is not being released yet.

(WSMV) - Metro Police are searching for the driver of a car neighbors said hit a group of children before speeding off Sunday night.

Neighbors said some watched as a driver hit a group of children while they were crossing the street on 12th Avenue South, but many are more shocked by how late the young children were outside. It’s an area many said they see children walking around daily.

“This is a community. We have kids that stay out here, so when I come through, I drive the speed limit,” Makayla Ward said.

When Ward saw a group of children walking along 12th Avenue South Sunday afternoon, she didn’t think much of it.

“They were heading towards the Smoothie King,” Ward said.

Metro Police said the children were between the ages of 5 and 10.

“I see them so many times in the neighborhood crossing the street, and you can tell someone taught them,” Ward said.

Just hours after one woman said she told the group to go home, she heard a crash. Neighbors said someone driving a brownish car around 7:30 p.m. Sunday crashed into the five children crossing at the intersection of 12th Avenue South and Horton Avenue.

“Immediately when I heard, I rolled over and saw what was going on, and I was literally was in shock, like mouth wide open in disbelief. I cannot believe that happened to that group of kids,” Ward said.

Witnesses said the two women were in the brown car that sped off toward Wedgewood Avenue.

“I really don’t know what came over her. i really don’t know,” Ward said.

Two witnesses said they believed the car had a green light and the children may have cross when they shouldn’t have, but Ward heard something else.

“To hear the kids say that she told them come on and the proceeded, I was just in shock. How can you do that to some kids? They are children,” Ward said.

Police said two of the children were taken to the hospital for body aches. Officers are on the lookout for the driver responsible.

“I hope they catch her, and I hope that she is held accountable for what she’s done,” Ward said.

Ward said she and other parents in the area are now keeping an even closer eye on their children.","After 5 children were hurt after the struck in a hit-and-run, Edgehill neighbors are still in shock, Sharon Danquah reports.",13204,US,True,1.0,The headline references all key parties involved in the crash: the driver and the children (referred to as '5 kids').,1.0,"The headline refers to the children as '5 kids,' which is a human term.

(WSMV) - A rear-end crash in South Nashville quickly turned into a life-threatening situation.

A couple spoke to WSMV how the early morning fender-bender turned into a hit-and-run.

The crash happened on Murfreesboro Pike and Smith Springs Road. A couple driving through an intersection said seconds after being hit, the situation only got worse.

“It all happened out of nowhere,” said driver Courtney Murphy. “It was very traumatic actually.”

Murphy explained as she approached the light at the Murfreesboro Pike and Smith Springs Road intersection, she noticed a car behind her going fast.

As she turned to her boyfriend in the passenger seat to share her concern, Murphy said her body jerked forward.

“As soon as I finished the sentence, he rear-ended us,” Murphy said. “We started to spin a couple of times until I was able to hit the brakes and finally we ended up on the other side of the street this way,” Murphy explained.

When their car came to a screeching halt, Murphy said her boyfriend Justin Johnson jumped out and started documenting on his phone.

“The front of his car was pretty much totaled so he had to get himself together,” Murphy said. “By the time he got out, I realized he was kind of stumbling a little bit.”

Murphy said the other driver and Johnson talked and looked at the cars.

While the couple stood in awe, struggling to communicate with the driver who rear-ended them, something else happened.

Murphy said the guy was getting cold so he ran across the street to get his jacket, however, before he got to his car, another car hits him.

“Another car comes, the white car, and hits him speeding,” Murphy said.

The couple said it all happened so fast.

“It was looking very gruesome,” Johnson said. “It looked very bad for him. He was literally ran over. They whole car went over his body and he still survived.”

In video sent in by Johnson, the car can be seen smashed into the side of the road with the man stuck under the back wheel.

What happened next, Murphy said was heartbreaking.

“The driver took off running and the passenger side gets out of the car and he started to take off running but eventually came back,” Murphy said.

Murphy added that the driver never came back.

While emergency crews rushed the man to a nearby hospital, the couple started praying.

“Regardless of how frustrating it was when he first hit us, he didn’t deserve to be hit by another car. He didn’t deserve that at all. That was just crazy,” Murphy said.

WSMV4 is working to find out the condition of the man hit in the middle of the road. We reached out to Metro Police, but they have not responded. Witnesses said he was conscious before crews took him to a nearby hospital.","A man that rear-ended a couple was later hit while crossing the street in a hit-and-run crash in South Nashville, Sharon Danquah reports.",13159,US,True,1.0,"The headline references 'Couple' and 'pedestrian,' which are all key parties involved in the crash as described in the article body.",1.0,"The headline refers to 'Couple' and 'pedestrian,' which are human terms.",1.0,"The headline uses active voice to describe the actions, such as 'witnesses pedestrian hit-and-run,' clearly showing who performed the action.","Driver hits couple's car, then witnesses another driver strike pedestrian in South Nashville","The original headline mentioned 'a couple' and 'pedestrian.'

(WSMV) - Lebanon Police said they need the public’s help in finding a red four-door sedan allegedly involved in a hit and run over the weekend. The person who said she was hit is a mother of five. She said she is now paralyzed.

The woman said she was walking out of the leasing office with her mail when her life changed in a matter of seconds.

“When I was in the air, those three seconds, I thought that was it,” Chelsea Stiltner said. “I thought that when I hit the pavement, I am done.”

Stiltner sat in a wheelchair Thursday afternoon. This comes after she said a car hit her in her apartment complex’s parking lot Saturday evening.

“I mean, I can’t go to the bathroom by myself,” the 28-year-old parent said. “I can’t even hold my 2-year-old.”

Stiltner said she went to pick up her mail inside the leasing office. When she stepped out, she said a gust of wind blew it out of her hands.

“I saw a car in the distance,” Stiltner said. “I did like the wave, and I went down to pick up the mail. I heard an engine rev, and by the time I looked up, it was already hitting me.”

Lebanon Police said Stiltner was injured with lacerations to her face and arms and pain throughout her body. Stiltner said after four hours at the hospital, she was discharged. The next day, Stiltner said she had a seizure.

“I can’t feel anything from the knee down and from the knee up, I have 5 to 10 percent mobility,” Stiltner said.

Lebanon Police said there is no video that captured what happened. They also couldn’t find any witnesses or the car and are asking anyone with information to come forward.

“In 10 seconds, a big portion of who I am was entirely ripped away so it was an adjustment to learn to rewalk at 28,” Stiltner said.

(WSMV) - Metro Nashville Police arrested a man for allegedly crashing into another vehicle during a drag race, killing the driver on Monday afternoon.

According to MNPD, 31-year-old Patrick Ewin was driving over 100 mph in a white Dodge Charger Hellcat when he lost control and collided with a Honda Insight on Clarksville Pike. Video footage shows the Hellcat racing another white Charger when it lost control and swerved into oncoming traffic, striking the driver’s side of the Honda, according to the arrest affidavit.

The driver of the Honda, 34-year-old Jacob Barnhardt, became trapped after the crash and had to be extracted from the vehicle. Barnhardt was transported to Vanderbilt Medical Center where he was pronounced dead.

Denise Harris works on Clarksville Pike and started recording cell phone footage of the scene after hearing a loud boom.

“It was definitely tragic. A lot of us were outside. People were crying and it was just something that could have been avoided,” Harris said.

Since the road was blocked for some time, Simon, manager of Exotic Nails, said he decided to close his shop early.

“The police cut the door into pieces and pulled him out,” Simon explained.

Harris is now hoping this incident will push people to be more cautious on the road.

“I definitely do think this is something that should open everyone’s eyes. I do feel like if people want to be drag racing or want to race cars, I think they should invest in going into NASCAR,” said Harris.

Ewin was arrested and booked on vehicular homicide charges. He remains in custody on a $75,000 bond.

Law enforcement’s preliminary investigation revealed that a Holiday Inn Ford Transit passenger van was traveling on West End Avenue in Nashville when it struck Smith, who had begun to walk across the street from north to south.

Smith was walking with his family members, one of which attempted to alert him of the traffic. Smith is believed to have not heard his family’s warning, a document presented to media members stated.

Mid-Town Hills Precinct officers responded to the accident at 10:18 p.m. Smith was transported to Vanderbilt Medical Center where he pronounced dead. Smith was in Nashville to watch Campbell play in the Hawkeyes’ bowl game against the Kentucky Wildcats on Saturday.

“Our hearts are with Jack and his entire family as they grieve the tragic death of their grandfather and father, William Smith Jr.,” Iowa head football coach Kirk Ferentz said in a prepared statement. “We know Mr. Smith was a strong influence on his grandson and a faithful Hawkeye football supporter. All of us – players, coaches, and staff members – will keep the Campbell family in our thoughts and prayers during this profoundly difficult time.”

Iowa Athletics noted in a release that Campbell’s parents waited until after the Music City Bowl to inform him of his grandfather’s death. Campbell’s parents made that decision so he could enjoy his last game as a Hawkeye.

Campbell contributed heavily in Iowa’s 21-0 win over Kentucky at Nissan Stadium Saturday, recording 10 tackles and one sack.

The multi-vehicle crash along the turnpike happened in Sandusky County early Friday afternoon.

Troopers said there were multiple crashes emergency officials responded to on the Ohio Turnpike eastbound lanes between state route 53 and route 4 in Erie County. The road was closed in both directions Friday.

Eastbound lanes reopened Saturday around 4:40 p.m., according to Turnpike officials, who said Westbound lanes reopened to traffic shortly after 3 p.m. Saturday. A right lane closure remains for about a mile stretch of the eastbound lanes due to damaged commercial vehicles that haven’t been removed.

Buses took people stranded on the turnpike to the Castalia Maintenance Building, according to the PIO for the Ohio Turnpike and Infrastructure Commission. Video obtained by 13abc showed first responders helping people out of their vehicles.

A spokesperson for OSHP tells 13abc the first of a number of crashes happened around 11:45 a.m. near state route 2. Two people were injured with non-life-threatening injuries in a five-car crash, troopers said. The massive pileup happened shortly thereafter when multiple cars crashed around 12:30 p.m.

“This crash unfortunately is an example of why you should stay home if you can,” said Ohio State Highway Patrol Sgt. Ryan Purpura. “A lot of people lost their lives today. It’s imperative that you stay home if you can and, if you absolutely do have to travel, we ask you to take your time, be patient, slow down, increase your following distance, and wear your safety belt.”

Toledo Fire and Rescue officials said crews requested their assistance with extrication resources. The department said they rescued two people from the wreckage and recovered two dead victims.

Troopers said visibility was a problem on the turnpike with the winds blowing. The crash came amid frigid temps and strong winds, with Sandusky County under a level 3 snow emergency as of late Friday afternoon.

Jerry N. Hruby, the chairman of the Ohio Turnpike and Infrastructure Commission, issued a statement late Saturday commending the hundreds of first responders and civilians who helped with rescue efforts.

“Our deepest sympathy goes to those affected by this tragic event, especially the families of those who lost their lives. You are in our prayers,” Hruby said.

(WVLT) - At around 12:30 p.m. Tuesday, a train derailed in Collegedale near Chattanooga after hitting a bridge beam that was being transported by a tractor-trailer, according to Tennessee Department of Transportation officials.

The crash happened near the intersection of Apison Pike and University Drive between a tractor-trailer and a Norfolk Southern train.

The tractor-trailer was carrying a 134-foot concrete truss beam and was stopped on the railroad tracks waiting for the light to turn green on Tucker Road.

During that time, Chattanooga Fire Department officials said the Norfolk Southern railroad crews activated the crossing arms.

However, the tractor-trailer did not clear the tracks in time and was hit by the train.

Three locomotives and 10 railroad cars then derailed and slammed into each other in what fire officials called “a disastrous mess.”

A crash investigation must be completed and the train cleared before the roads can be reopened. TDOT officials said it would be a “lengthy closure,” but the intersection was reopened at 7:00 p.m.

The CFD’s Hazmat Team worked to stop a diesel and lube oil leak from two of the locomotives.

Hamilton County EMA officials said two employees were left with minor injuries, but the driver of the tractor-trailer was not injured.

(WSMV) - An East Nashville neighborhood is demanding change after a crash on Shelby Avenue.

A witness said a man was hit by a truck while walking across the road toward a Shell gas station. This happened at an intersection many said is dangerous.

At the top of a surveillance picture, you can see a dark figure standing along Shelby Avenue. It’s the image of man a gas station clerk said she watched weave through traffic seconds before a truck crashed into someone else.

“Wow,” East Nashville resident Isom Jones said.

That was the reaction of many people now walking the street after Metro Police said the driver of the truck admitted to being distracted by the man weaving through traffic before crashing into another man in the crosswalk.

“I’m watching every car,” Jones said.

For more than 15 years Jones said he’s made that same walk along the Shelby Avenue crosswalk fearing for his life.

“People drive fast over here,” Jones said.

Isom isn’t the only one speaking out about the intersection.

Jef Bjarnson said he also sees a major issue.

“I know there’s this idea that they have to yield to you, but I’m always yielding to cars,” Bjarnson said.

Without a traffic light at the intersection, Metro Police said the crash at around 5:30 p.m. Sunday was the fault of the truck driver who failed to yield to people walking in the crosswalk.

“I’m so sorry that happened, but you have to pay attention in the car and walking. Everyone has to pay attention to what they’re doing,” Jones said.

Jones said this isn’t the first time this has happened.

“One of my neighbors got hit by the arm of a dump truck,” Jones said.

Aside from getting a traffic light at the intersection, Jones suggests one change be made immediately.

“We need some of those yield to pedestrian signs right here. That would be helpful,” Jones said.

As for the man hit Sunday night, family members said he’s now being treated for two broken legs and a few broken ribs.

(WSMV) - A vehicle nearly crashed into a Springfield home on Tuesday night, according to Smokey Barn News.

The vehicle was involved in a rollover crash at around 5:30 p.m. on Highway 41 near Courtland Road. The crash sent the vehicle off the roadway, up an embankment, through a fence, and over a parked vehicle.

The car came to a stop a few feet from the front door of a nearby home, landing just inches from an American flag in the front yard.

Officials at the scene told SBN that the driver of the vehicle was transported to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.

The vehicle was removed without causing any damage to the home, but the car itself was deemed a total loss.

The cause of the crash is under investigation by the Springfield Police Department. Drugs and alcohol did not appear to be a factor in the crash and no charges have been filed.","The car came to a stop a few feet from the front door of a nearby home, landing just inches from an American flag in the front yard.",12193,US,True,0.0,"The headline mentions the vehicle but does not explicitly mention the driver, who is a key party involved in the crash.",0.0,"The headline refers to the vehicle rather than the driver, which is a dehumanizing term.",1.0,"The headline uses active voice to describe the crash event, stating 'Crash sends vehicle off roadway, into front yard of Springfield home.'","Driver sends car off roadway, into front yard of Springfield home",The original headline did not mention the driver.

(WKRN) — Tennessee is on track for the worst year in at least a decade for pedestrian deaths, and after being hit following a night out, three friends are thankful they are not part of that statistic.

Julie Bostian, Gary Bendar and David Diamond were having a night out at Never Never Bar in Nashville’s Wedgewood-Houston neighborhood and were hit by a black Mustang while the car at the corner of Houston Street and Pillow Street, according to Metro police.

“Up until that point, it was a pretty amazing night. Just singing, dancing, goofy stuff,” Diamond said.

All three said they are bruised and sore but doing well and recovering.

“A couple of days after there are more blues than blacks, but we are coming out of it I think,” Diamond said.

Metro police said all three were hit, but specified that Bostian was thrown on her back into the middle of the street and Bendar rolled over the top of the car before landing on the asphalt.

However, they are facing injuries that can’t be seen through a screen.

“I went out of the house for the first time this morning. My husband was driving of course and I reached out and grabbed at him as a car was pulling in front of us and he was like, ‘you’re probably going to feel that for a little bit,'” Bostian said, “My initial reaction was just to freak out, which just is not normal for me to do that.”

Diamond said for the first time in his decade of living in Music City, he is thinking about his own safety and security differently.

“This is the first time that I’ve been out and like, ‘Hey! That was like a touch of evil,’ and not what I typically associate with Nashville and going out and Nashville and being in Nashville,” he said.

They said they still can’t wrap their heads around how someone just drives away after a hit-and-run.

“That someone would leave us laying in the middle of the street, hurt, and not stop or check on us that is probably the most shocking out of all of it,” Bostian said. “Accidents happen whether it was distracted or drunk, but you can’t run over three people and not know.”

The business owner whose security video captured the incident said he has been warning his councilmember this is a dangerous street for pedestrians.

“I multiple times said to Colby, ‘someone is going to die, this street is too narrow, there are too many people and here we are,'” said Clean Plate Club owner Chris Holmes.

The Metro councilmember who oversees the area where the incident occurred said he has been working to make Houston Street a one-way road and got the application to do so approved in September.

“[Y]et nothing has been done since: no striping, signage, or change of traffic flow. I’ve been constantly checking in since then and still nothing has changed…This is unacceptable, as signage could have been in place months ago,” said Councilmember Colby Sledge. “If Houston St. had already been one-way by now, this incident would not have happened, because that car would not have been there.”

According to NDOT, there are plans to convert Houston Street to a one-way, which was proposed by the area developer. A spokesperson for the department said they hope to have that plan by the end of the week for the team to review.","Julie Bostian, Gary Bendar and David Diamond were having a night out at Never Never Bar in Nashville’s Wedgewood-Houston neighborhood and were hit by a black Mustang while the car at the corner of Houston Street and Pillow Street, according to Metro police.",12200,US,True,0.0,The headline mentions the victims ('three people') but does not reference the driver or the vehicle involved in the crash.,1.0,"The headline refers to the victims as 'three people,' which is a human term.",1.0,"The headline uses active voice with the phrase 'You can’t run over three people and not know,' clearly showing the action performed by the driver.","Driver of black Mustang hits three pedestrians, leaves them injured and confused",The original headline did not mention the driver of the car.

(WKRN) — Portland Police are searching for the person responsible for hitting a man with his car and driving away from the scene of the crash. 

The pedestrian was struck Saturday evening near TGT Road and Highway 109. He was taken to the hospital with serious injuries and told police the driver did stop briefly before taking off.  

“First of all, just as a decent human being you would want to render aid to someone who needs help,” Police Chief Jason Williams said. “The individual that was struck did have a conversation with the driver of the vehicle who told him that his license was suspended or revoked for failure to pay child support. And so, he didn’t want to call the police for that reason.” 

Chief Williams said it’s never okay to leave the scene of a pedestrian crash and said the driver will likely face additional charges for leaving. 

“It doesn’t help anything because if you hit somebody and it’s an accident, clearly there’s not always charges for that. But if you drive away and you don’t render aid like you should, you don’t notify the police then that becomes an additional issue,” Williams said.  

Police are looking for a dark-colored sedan with damage to the windshield. The suspect is described as a white male in his early 30s around 5-foot-11 with a mustache.  

Chief Williams said the department has already gotten tips from the public and is looking for any more information the community can provide.  

“When they hear about something like this, we have a community that wants to give us information if they have it. So we’ve already received some information from the community that we’re currently following up on,” Chief Williams said. “We don’t like pedestrians being struck by vehicles to begin with, but it’s even more of a concern when somebody does something like this and leaves the scene. We also understand that there’s reasons for everything so we’re interested in those reasons. We’d just like to have a conversation with the individual just so we can bring some closure to this.”",Portland Police are searching for the person responsible for hitting a man with his car and driving away from the scene of the crash.,12113,US,True,1.0,"The headline references both the 'hit-and-run driver' and the 'man' who was hit, covering all key parties involved in the crash.",1.0,"The headline refers to the 'driver' and the 'man' using human terms, not as objects or vehicles.",1.0,"The headline uses active voice with the phrase 'who left scene,' clearly showing the driver's action.",Portland man flees scene after striking pedestrian with his car,The original headline did not mention the pedestrian.

(WKRN) — Two Nashville men were hospitalized after a high-speed chase and radical rollover crash on Interstate 840.

And when the smoke cleared, Williamson County deputies recovered lots of drugs and guns.

The chase began in Cool Springs off I-65 South very early Sunday morning, which is when a deputy spotted a car driving well under the speed limit and not maintaining its lane.

When the deputy went to pull over the vehicle, the car sped away.

Within moments, the car was traveling at speeds approaching 120 mph before it eventually entered I-840 westbound.

Before deputies could catch up, the car lost control, going airborne and rolling multiple times.

The passenger, 24-year-old Cory Preston, was ejected and landed many yards away from the smoking vehicle.

Amazingly, the badly-injured man was able to stand and obey an officer’s commands to surrender.

Body cam video shows the officers ordering the obviously injured man down the berm to the side of the road. Once he got to the roadside, he was handcuffed, at that moment, the officer realized how badly hurt he was and immediately called for medics.

The driver, Kevin Cao, was also badly hurt. The collision was so ferocious that he was tossed into the back seat of the crumpled Nissan.

Deputies attempted to break the vehicle glass and open the car, but the metal is too badly mangled.

On body cam video, you hear Cao talk to the deputy and ask if his friend is okay.

While medics attended to Preston, fire crews arrived and used the jaws of life to extricate the injured driver.

Both men were taken to Vanderbilt University Medical Center for treatment.

When officers inspected the car, they found four pounds of marijuana, psychedelic mushrooms, cocaine, three handguns, and an assault-style rifle.

When they are released from the hospital, the men will be charged with a number of felonies, including drug possession for resale and reckless endangerment

A young girl who was hit by a truck during a parade in Raleigh, North Carolina, on Saturday has died, according to Raleigh Mayor Mary-Ann Baldwin.  A large crowd of people were watching the Raleigh Christmas Parade near the North Carolina State Capitol when a white truck pulling a float started drifting. Video from CNN affiliate WTVD appeared to show people running to get out of the way. But the truck hit a young girl, according to WTVD. “Our hearts are heavy as we mourn the loss of the young girl who lost her life today at the Raleigh Christmas Parade. Our prayers are with her family, friends and the dancers from CC & Co.,” Baldwin said in a tweet.  In a press release, the Raleigh Police Department identified the driver of the parade float truck as 20-year-old Landen Christopher Glass. Glass was arrested and is facing charges that include misdemeanor death by motor vehicle, unsafe movement and carrying a firearm in a parade, according to the release. He is being held at the Wake County Detention Center on a $4,000 bond and has a court appearance scheduled for Monday, according to online records from the Wake County Sheriff’s Office. It is unclear whether Glass has an attorney. North Carolina’s Gov. Roy Cooper also expressed his condolences, saying in a tweet, “In a joyous season on what should be a happy day, we instead mourn for this family and their friends as we keep them in our prayers.” One eyewitness, Justin Kase Conder, told CNN the raised pick-up truck suddenly pulled forward, honked an air horn and “people started screaming.” Multiple witnesses said the white truck lost control. And some people said they heard the driver screaming out of the truck’s window that he couldn’t stop the vehicle, according to WTVD. Raleigh police responded to the incident and both people in the truck were escorted away from the scene and placed in a police vehicle.  The float was carrying some members of the CC & Co. Dance troupe. The dance troupe had 200 performers in the parade, with some as young as five years old, according to WTVD.  “We are still in shock as we write these words to you. This morning’s events have devastated us. We also know many of our young ones witnessed this tragedy and that is hard to fathom as well,” the dance company said in a Facebook post. A police investigation is underway and the remainder of the Raleigh Christmas Parade was canceled because of the incident, according to WTVD.

The Pima County Sheriff’s Department responded to a collision around 7 p.m. at the intersection of West El Tiro Road and North Puma Road in the Avra Valley area.

Traffic detectives said a Nissan Altima was driving north on Puma Road and was making a left-hand turn to go west on El Tiro Road when a Hyundai Sonata heading east on El Tiro Road crossed into the westbound lane and hit the Nissan.

The Nissan was occupied by three people, including two children. A 3-year-old boy sustained life-threatening injuries and was taken to a nearby hospital, where he died. The other child was also taken to a nearby hospital and is expected to survive.

Both children had been properly restrained, according to the PCSD.

Just before midnight, police were called to a crash with injuries at the intersection of 19th Street and Chicago Ave. Investigators say 21-year-old Uris Lagunes was traveling east in the 5400 block of 19th Street. The driver of a Hyundai Elantra passenger car, 18-year-old Lexy Vasquez along with three other passengers, were traveling west in the 5400 block of 19th Street. The Nissan Altima crossed over into the westbound lanes, and struck the Hyundai Elantra head-on in the center lane.

Vasquez was taken to Covenant with serious injuries.

Lagunes and one passenger of the Hyundai Elantra were taken to UMC with serious injuries. The remaining two passengers of the Hyundai Elantra were taken to UMC with moderate injuries.

Police interviewed Lagunes while at UMC, according to a police report. He told police he drank two beers while at the Buffalo Wild Wings at 19th and Milwaukee prior to driving.

He was asked to rate the severity of his intoxication on a scale from zero to 10, with zero being not intoxicated at all and 10 being the most intoxicated he had ever felt. Lagunes rated his intoxication level at the time of the crash at a six.

When asked further questions, Lagunes refused to cooperate with police. The report stated he was “acting like he was asleep.”

As he headed from his home in Lakewood down 6th Ave., he saw cars turned sideways on the highway.

At first, he was confused, wondering why so many vehicles were pulled over. Then, as he lost control of his truck and crashed, he realized why. There was a pile-up on the icy road before him that he was now a part of.

Another vehicle hit his truck from the side.

“I got T-boned super hard,” he said. “If I was in a [smaller] car, I would have probably been dead.”

Once cars around him stopped slamming into each other, he tried to open his door but couldn’t. So he climbed out of the window and over a couple of cars.

Adrenaline flooded through his body. As he stepped on the ground, he realized his leg could not support his weight. He would learn later at the hospital that his ankle was sprained.

The scene on the three-lane stretch of 6th Ave. around him could’ve been taken from a post-apocalyptic disaster movie. Sedans were turned the wrong way; pickup trucks almost pinned to the concrete border; SUVs strewn about.

In all, about 100 cars were part of the massive wreck that shut down traffic from N. Federal Blvd. to Kalamath St. for several hours. The wreck came on the heels of Denver’s first recorded snowfall, and while the cause of the crash has yet to be determined, the Department of Transportation and Infrastructure said the road was not treated with deicer overnight.

Throughout the morning, tow trucks backed in and out of the collision site on 6th Ave. clearing cars. Street sweeping trucks and city staff had begun cleaning the smashed lights, glass, parts of seats, crushed license plates and bits of metal littering the highway.

One Ford Escape, crushed against another car in front and completely smashed in the back, still had its left tail light blinking as other cars were cleared.

“It looked like just piles and piles of cars on the highway,” said Bradley Pearlman, one of several tow truck drivers who were called to the scene. He arrived around 6:30 a.m.

Another tow truck driver, Lee Duvall, arrived hours before when the pileup was just beginning.

“Nobody knew what was going on,” he said. “We came out here, it went from 10 cars to 20 cars to 100 cars plus.”

Duvall said the road was slippery when he arrived. “It was a sheet of ice. When I jumped out of my truck, I almost broke my neck,” he said.
Though police have not said exactly what caused the accident, several motorists, tow truck drivers and onlookers said the road was icy after the city’s first recorded snowfall of the season.

Denver’s Department of Transportation and Infrastructure said in a statement that it monitored conditions on 6th Ave. after Thursday night’s snowfall. Crews determined at 4:30 a.m. that treating the roads with deicer would not have been effective. Denver Police said it first received a call about the massive crash at 5:40 a.m.

“In Colorado, road conditions can change quickly, which is what happened along 6th Ave creating slick conditions before we had a chance to return to the area,” DOTI said in a statement.

The Fire Department evaluated 83 people on the scene, and transported 13 to the hospital. According to officials, only one person sustained serious injuries. The Fire Department also had to extricate six people trapped in their cars.

Toshia Reyes also drove across 6th Ave early in the morning, but fared better than most of the drivers that followed her.

She made it to her shift at LaMar’s Donuts and Coffee not long before the crash, and considers herself lucky.

“I hit black ice right about the overpass, and then I laid off my gas, got over three lanes so I wouldn’t go into the side rail, got control of my car and started braking,” she said.

Reyes drives over the bridge to work regularly, and said ice on it is not uncommon during colder seasons. “It didn’t surprise me what happened,” she said.

LaMar’s faces the 6th Ave. exit, so Reyes served people trickling in from the scene throughout the morning. At one point, police came in to brief paramedics who had gathered there. One driver who walked in off the highway was starting his birthday in an undesirable fashion.

“I said ‘what do you get for your birthday?'” she recalled. “He said, ‘a new car.'”
A parking lot at Empower Field turned into a de facto wreck yard as tow truck drivers were directed to take totaled and damaged cars there.

Early risers who crashed their cars while heading to work before dawn walked around their cars, inspecting damage. Family members of crash victims snapped photos of the cars. Other people took out whatever boxes, coats and bags they needed to bring home with them.

A woman named Sharon, who declined to share her last name as she was shaken up from the accident, woke up early to enjoy her normal Friday routine — sometime before 6 a.m.

She recalled how, as she drove to her job in the oil and gas industry, she crested the hill on 6th Avenue and saw “a wall of cars in front of me.” She hit the brakes but still slid into some vehicles.

“I sat there hanging onto the steering wheel as other cars kept slamming into me, just bam, bam bam,” she said. She guesses it was just a minute and a half that she sat there, but it felt like an eternity. “I kept thinking, ‘Are any of these cars going to blow?'”

When the “bam, bam, bam” faded further into the distance, she was able to get out of the car and stood with other people, she said. “I just watched and heard the ‘bam, bam, bam” and smoke as far as you could see.”

She was at Empower Field to take photos of her SUV and to report the crash to the insurance company.

Nearby, police, other families and media milled about, as humming tow trucks weaved between them.

As tow truck driver Zay Meha looked around the parking lot, he wondered what had happened to the people in the demolished vehicles.

“That’s a pretty bad accident if your wheel fell off on an SUV,” he said. “That’s scary. No airbags came out, so hopefully they weren’t injured. That’s pretty, pretty sad. I don’t like to see people get hurt, you know?”

This was the first time Meha has experienced the effects of such a large pile-up.

“I mean, there’s a football stadium, and it’s being used like a scrap yard for now,” he said. “It’s crazy.”

Reedah Aritz has been driving a tow truck for about a year.

“When I heard about a 100-car car pile up, I couldn’t take it seriously,” he said. “I thought it was an exaggeration.”

But looking at the cars at the Empower Field lot, he realized it was all too real.

“It can be quite traumatizing,” he said, looking at some of the vehicles that had arrived and imagining the people who had been in them. “We have that car that’s smashed all the way. I mean, who knows what went through their mind when they were just smashed in.” He pointed to another car. “Who knows what went through their mind when their car was just completely disintegrated?”
Given the number of cars involved, the insurance claims will get complicated.

Skyler McKinley, Regional Director of Public Affairs for AAA, said that with such a big crash, figuring out who is at fault and litigating between many different insurance companies will likely take a while. Plus, he said insurance companies are already backed up with claims from the Marshall Fire and with car thefts on the rise.

This means some might have to pay out of pocket up front for repairs, rental cars and new vehicles. Colorado is an at-fault state, so insurance companies can tell their customers to file with the insurance company of the person at fault. But figuring out who those people are given how chaotic Friday morning’s crash was -and pursuing litigation if any are uninsured — will be messy.

“For folks carrying only the bare minimum [insurance] in Colorado, this is an economic catastrophe,” McKinley said.

His advice for people involved in the crash is to document everything, call right away and file as fast as possible.

Gonzalez of the Silverado fortunately does have coverage. He walked around the yard, now on crutches, to inspect the damage on his truck.

Meha the tow truck driver offered him encouragement and to tow his truck to his home.

“I want to get the process going because this kind of ruined my day,” Gonzalez said.

Gonzalez will be able to replace his truck and he has another car to get around town and to work. But he’ll need a few days off from his job at Deep Rock, so he’ll be a bit short on money he needs to get by.

But he’s looking at the biggest positive of the day.

“At least I walked away with my life,” he said.

The 17-year-old boy from Milwaukee was killed in a multi-vehicle crash that closed West Mason and Oneida Streets Sunday night. Police identified him as Cruz Beltron. A GoFundMe has been set up for his family.

According to a Green Bay Police Department report, officers were dispatched at 7:40 p.m. Sunday, Oct. 30 to the 1200 block of West Mason Street to a crash that involved at least three vehicles. Officers say that excessive speed was a factor in the crash.

When officers arrived on the scene, it was discovered that the occupants of one of the involved vehicles fled the scene.

In a newly filed criminal complaint, police identified a suspect in the case as a 15-year-old girl. Police said the driver was taken to the Brown County Juvenile Detention Center on Monday after turning herself in to police.

According to statements in the complaint, the girl had taken her mother's car without her permission. Prior to the crash, she had spent some time hanging out with friends.

When police interviewed the driver, she was asked how fast did she think she was going and she thought it was not over 55 MPH. When investigators asked the suspect why was she driving so fast and she said that, ""she did not know and that she just was.""

According to the criminal complaint, police informed the suspect that she was traveling in excess of 100 MPH and she said that she did not think that was right. She also denied using any alcohol or drug prior to the crash.

The criminal complaint says police asked why did she not stop for the red light at the intersection and she stated that she saw that the light was green, but then it turned yellow so she thought she could make it through the intersection.

Police asked why did she not stay at the scene or contact law enforcement. According to the criminal complaint, she said that she did not really know and that she was scared.

Investigators analyzed nearby surveillance video from a local gas station that showed the crash.

According to a statement from a Green Bay Police sergeant in the criminal complaint, the suspect's car was going about 123 MPH prior to the crash. The posted speed limit in that area is 35 MPH.

The girl has been charged with first-degree reckless homicide, hit and run - resulting in death, and operating a vehicle without the owner's consent.

(AP) -- Authorities say a Kentucky police officer has died after his vehicle was hit by a pickup truck whose driver was suspected of being under the influence of alcohol.

Kentucky State Police said in a statement that London Police Officer Logan K. Medlock died in the crash, which took place at about 12:50 a.m. Sunday. Police said Medlock was on duty and driving through an intersection in London when his police cruiser was struck by a pickup truck.

A preliminary investigation by the Kentucky State Police shows that a 2022 Ram pickup truck driven by Casey P. Byrd was heading north along KY 229 when the truck t-boned Officer Medlock's 2019 Dodge Charger. The force of the impact caused both vehicles to crash into A.R. Dyche Cemetery where several headstones were damaged.

LPD says that Byrd was not hurt in the accident. Officer Medlock died at the scene of the crash.

Alcohol is a suspected factor in the crash according to KSP and Byrd has been charged with murder of a police officer while operating a motor vehicle under the influence with aggravating circumstances. He was taken to the Laurel County Correctional Center.

“Logan was an outstanding police officer,” said Police Chief Travis Dotson in an emotional statement Sunday morning. “We are heartbroken. I want to thank KSP and the Sheriff’s Office for stepping up and helping us at this time.”

Chief Dotson said the department is in “a horrible time of shock and disbelief. It’s a great loss for this community, and we will never forget.”

Utah Highway Patrol reports the crash occurred on SR-9, near milepost six, at around 9:23 p.m.

The motorcyclist was traveling at “excessive speeds” and “cutting in and out of traffic,” according to UHP. Following this, he crashed into the rear of a black Nissan Versa.

This caused the motorcyclist to be thrown from his vehicle into the westbound lane. Along with this, the motorcycle slid into the shoulder of the westbound lane and burst into flames.

UHP says the motorcyclist was taken to an area hospital, where he died from his injuries. 

No injuries from the Nissan Versa were reported.

Marcus Webster, 19, Swazine Swindle, 17, Kevin Payne, 16, and Ahjanae Harper, 14, were killed when the stolen Kia they were riding in crashed Monday morning, ejecting them and one other passenger, WGRZ reporter Claudine Ewing confirmed Tuesday.

The driver, 16, was treated at the hospital and released, while a fifth passenger, a 14-year-old girl, is listed in good condition at Erie County Medical Center.

In a video shared on Twitter, a local says Harper had recently welcomed a baby girl.

“She was a young mother,” the man remembers. “She definitely spent a lot of time with her daughter.”

Harper was set to celebrate her 15th birthday on Nov. 1. Her family launched a $15,000 GoFundMe in her honor on Tuesday.

Swindle’s sister, Nashira Anderson, told WIBV that the teen enjoyed playing basketball and was known for his goofy personality.

Webster is said to have been a hard worker who juggled school and a job.

The driver of the Kia, which was reported stolen Sunday night, has since been charged with unauthorized use of a vehicle and criminal possession of stolen property. He is due back in court in November.

The teens are believed to have wrecked the car while trying to complete the “Kia challenge,” a TikTok trend that shows viewers how to hot-wire Kias and Hyundais.

Buffalo Police Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia told reporters Monday that law enforcement has seen a spike in car thefts since the challenge went viral. Even so, experts remain skeptical that an online dare can inspire random people to commit an illegal act.

“Isolating a specific video that seems detrimental, and assuming that it has a huge impact over people’s behavior, is just unreasonable from an empirical point of view. That’s not how media effects work,” Yotam Ophir, an assistant professor in the University at Buffalo communication department, told WIBV. 

“Most people don’t know about these challenges, most people don’t care about these challenges, and even if they watch these videos and find them amusing, it doesn’t mean they’re going to walk out and steal a car.”

The investigation into the accident remains ongoing.

“We certainly send our deepest condolences and sympathies to all the families, and everyone impacted by this unfortunate and horrific tragedy,” the Buffalo Public School District stated in the wake of the crash.","Ahjanae Harper, 14, left behind a baby daughter when she was killed in a Kia car crash with three other teens in Buffalo on Monday.",12060,US,True,1.0,The headline references all key parties involved in the crash: '4 teens' and 'young mom.',1.0,The headline refers to all involved parties as humans: 'young mom' and '4 teens.',0.0,"The headline uses passive construction ('killed in crash') to describe the harm to humans, obscuring agency.","Teen driver crashes stolen Kia, killing four passengers including young mom Ahjanae Harper","The original headline mentioned '4 teens' but did not specify the driver.

(WTVF) — A man driving on James Robertson Parkway Tuesday is now charged with hitting a pedestrian in the crosswalk.

The woman was critically injured from the incident.

Metro Nashville Police Department officials said they issued James Smallwood, of Madison, a citation for failure to yield resulting in bodily injury. The woman was crossing at the intersection of 7th Avenue North when she was struck by the Mitsubishi Lancer. She was transported to Vanderbilt University Medical Center with life-threatening injuries.

Smallwood showed no signs of impairment on scene and was wearing his seatbelt at the time of the crash.

Drivers are supposed to stop for pedestrians crossing in marked crosswalks.

But it doesn't always happen.

Michelle Beatty and Peter Smith are visiting Nashville from the United Kingdom.

They're taking in all the sights and sounds of Music City including the traffic.

""Look for the warning lights but you can’t see the warning lights as a pedestrian, so I don’t know if that’s a sign for the driver or for us. But again, the traffic stopped,"" said Beatty.

It was just a few hours before when this area here looked a lot different.

Crime scene tape and police cars covered the street along James Robertson Parkway and 7th avenue North after a call came in that a woman was hit by a car, critically injured walking through the crosswalk.

""Something to bring more attention and also I think it was dark, pretty dark when it happened too,"" said Mark Storz who works nearby.

Our cameras caught one person choosing to run across the crosswalk just in case cars decide not to stop.

This woman started to cross but took a step back when she saw no one was going to stop.

""It is tough but you see it every day just cars going by here, so you have got to be extra careful,"" said Storz.

Tennessee law requires drivers to yield to pedestrians when pedestrians are already walking through the crosswalk.

Tennessee Department of Transportation says there is no requirement in TN for drivers to yield when the pedestrian is about to enter the crosswalk.

For their part, pedestrians must wait to enter the half of the roadway upon which the driver is approaching if it would be “impossible” for the driver to stop.

""When it comes to these crosswalks, I see it all the time, cars just blow past it. It also makes you aware as a walker that you need to be aware as well because they’re not going to pay attention to these signs even though it’s marked pretty well,"" said Storz.

The crosswalks over James Robertson Pkwy between the Capitol and Bicentennial Mall have flashing beacons, pedestrian scale lighting, and the textured road surfaces to draw drivers attention to these crosswalks.

TDOT does have programs proactively focusing on upgrading the crosswalks with the worst crash history and potential in the state.

The officer made contact with Durham and saw indicators of impairment to include slurred speech, dilated pupils and he was unsteady on his feet, according to the arrest affidavit. Police said Durham was later sitting in the back of a patrol car and an officer could “smell the obvious odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from his breath and person.” Police said his eyes were also blood shot and watery and his speech was slow and mumbled.

Durham was requested to do a field sobriety test, which he refused by saying “lawyer,” according to the affidavit. He also refused a blood test and stated, “lawyer.”

Police said during a search incident to arrest Durham, officers located a green metal grinder with marijuana residue.

According to the affidavit, when an officer was attempting to place handcuffs on Durham and place him under arrest, Durham physically resisted and tried to pull away from the officer.

GEORGE —A motorcyclist was killed after he was struck by a vehicle on Sunset Boulevard Wednesday morning.

St. George Police officer Tiffany Mitchell said a red car driven by an elderly male was turning left, or westbound, out of the Speedway gas station parking lot onto Sunset. The motorcycle was headed eastbound when it was struck by the vehicle.

Mitchell confirmed to St. George News the motorcycle driver died after he had been taken to the hospital by Gold Cross Ambulance.

The crash occurred in front of the Sunset Plaza shopping center, just before the crossing of Sunset Boulevard and North Dixie Downs Road. An employee of Lins told St. George News he was outside when the incident occurred and he, along with other bystanders, called 911.

“We have a motorcycle versus vehicle … so as you can see behind me, traffic is impacted,” Mitchell said in the video.

Metro Police responded to the scene of an apartment complex Thursday night. Officials report that a group of people were gathered in the apartment parking lot around 9:40 p.m.

Investigations show that Deandre Conway, 23, opened fire on Terry Farmer, 24, after a brief altercation. Farmer was hit multiple times and was transported to Vanderbilt University Medical Center, where he later died.

Police say that Conway started speeding away from the scene in a maroon Chevrolet Silverado pick-up truck toward Gallatin Pike.

Conway was driving at a high speed when he hit a Toyota Rav4 at Emmitt Avenue, as the Rav4 attempted to make a left-hand turn onto Gallatin Pike South.

Five teenagers inside the Rav4 had been leaving a haunted house tour. The teens were transported to local hospitals and are suffering from critical injuries.

One of the teens, Landen Guye, 17, was transported to Skyline Medical Center where he died.

""There’s Landen singing, he helped teach the staff our alma mater,"" said Dawn Wenning.

Wenning walks the halls of Sycamore High School where she is principal, remembering a great student.

She said the high school senior was in choir, student council, National Honor Society, and was on the yearbook staff.

He had a talent for drawing pictures and drawing people in.

Wenning says he'll be missed.

""Just that smile — he lit up the room. He was away positive,"" Wenning said. ""Never had an office referral in the four years that I've been his principal.""

Wenning now cherishes the memories she has on her phone.

""He was so comfortable in his own skin and who he was. He didn't apologize to anybody, but he was so confident to be a high school student,"" she said.

The Cheatham County School district said they're saddened by the loss, and offered their thoughts and prayers to the family.

They said they will have additional counselors available at Sycamore High School on Monday when students return from fall break.

The suspect, Conway, walked away from the scene of the crash.

Conway was arrested on Saturday morning by MNPD TITANS Detectives on Indian Lake Boulevard in Hendersonville.

The woman was cycling east on Parkside Avenue near Parade Place just before 7:30 a.m. when she fell off her bike and onto the street, according to preliminary information from the Crash Investigation Squad and a witness who spoke to the Daily News.

The 25-year-old was hit by the truck, suffered severe head and body injuries and died before she could be taken to the hospital, police said.

The driver of the tractor-trailer truck remained at the scene, said police.

Police claimed they were still investigating if the truck was larger than the city's 55-foot limit.

Illegally-sized trucks on New York City streets have long caused safety issues for pedestrians, bikers and other vehicles, and are often well-documented by eagle-eyed safe-streets advocates on Twitter.

Officials also said that they could not yet determine why the large tractor-trailer truck was driving on a road that was not a designated truck route, according to a 2021 DOT map, adding that all information released so far was preliminary.

According to the Daily News, a witness on the scene claimed to watch the woman fall off her bike as she tried to avoid a protruding side mirror from a parked pickup truck.

The witness then saw the woman get run over by the truck, adding that the driver ""had no remorse,"" after confronting him, according to the Daily News

Pictures from social media show the police response and the woman's bicycle with mangled handlebars.

Local Twitter users responded with anger over driving habits on the busy intersection near a public park.

""I live right near here,"" said one. ""Drivers run that red light all the time, it's ridiculous - so hard to cross there.""

""It’s wild,"" Sarah Clyne Sundberg added. ""Literally I regularly see drivers stop, then gun it across the crosswalk against a red light.""

Last summer, another bicyclist, Upper East Sider Carling Mott, 28, was killed by a truck driver who was also traveling on a non-truck route.

Police initially made false claims that Mott had been traveling the wrong way down the street, but later revised their statement to say the victim had been waiting for a red light on East 85th street.

The street lacked a safe bike lane, thanks to a years-ago outcry from white-stocking residents, including Woody Allen, who spoke out against the city's 2016 plans to install crosstown bike lanes in the notoriously congested neighborhood..

The uptown community board now claims be moving towards installing a bike lane in the wake of the tragic death.","The 25-year-old woman was biking on Parkside Avenue when she was hit Wednesday morning, police said.",11830,US,True,1.0,The headline references all key parties involved in the crash: 'Cyclist' and 'Tractor Trailer'.,1.0,"The headline refers to the cyclist as a human ('Cyclist') and the tractor trailer as a vehicle, but the driver is implied by the action ('struck by').",1.0,The headline uses active voice to describe the crash ('struck by').,Truck Driver Fatally Hits Woman Cyclist Outside Prospect Park: NYPD,The original headline mentioned the cyclist and the tractor-trailer but did not specify the driver.

(WSMV) - Three people were injured after a roll-over crash on Interstate 40 in Smith County, according to first responders.

The crash happened around 7:15 a.m. on the interstate. Two people were removed from the vehicle for treatment and taken to medical facilities with serious injuries. A third person was taken to the hospital for evaluation.

“He wasn’t an inmate,” Andrew Tufano told News Center 7′s Molly Koweek. “He was a father. He was a brother.”

>> RELATED: Inmate working on litter crew killed in chain-reaction crash on I-75

The Dayton Post of the Ohio State Highway Patrol is investigating the crash, which involved four vehicles and multiple pedestrians who were picking up litter as part of the Montgomery County Solid Waste Little Program.

A box truck, headed south on I-75 near the exit to state Route 741 in Moraine, struck a stopped county sheriff’s transport van just after 11 a.m. The impact pushed the van into the litter crew. The box truck continued left, across the lanes of I-75 South and hit the center concrete median barrier. There, it was struck by two southbound vehicles.

The worker, identified as 52-year-old Tim Tufano, suffered fatal injuries at the scene.

The other litter crew workers were injured and taken to area hospitals. The driver of one of the southbound vehicles suffered minor injuries and was taken to a hospital. The driver of the box truck and the driver of the other southbound vehicle “claimed possible minor injuries.”

The interstate was closed for approximately five hours.

Tufano had “a little bit” of a drinking problem, Andrew said, which may have been aggravated by the death of a fiancee a few months ago.

“He battled with himself with all of that,” the son said, noting his father was in the Montgomery County Jail on a DUI conviction -- and it wasn’t his first such conviction.

According to Montgomery County online court records, Tim Tufano was serving a 90-day mandatory jail sentence because he violated probation on a charge of operating a vehicle while under the influence (prior felony/under the influence). A second count was dismissed. Judge Mary Katherine Huffman also suspended Tufano’s driver’s license for 10 years as part of his punishment.

Even still, Andrew said his father is to be remembered as a “very firm and stern man” who was a family person and “an amazing dad and grandpa” who taught him how to be a father to his six children.

“When I needed him, he was there,” Andrew said.

As an example, he recalled when Tim Tufano was present and supportive when one of his grandchildren died.

“She has somebody there for her now,” Andrew said. “The only thing that’s bringing me comfort is that our daughter, Annabelle, and him are together.”","Dayton man hit, killed on I-75 while working on jail inmate litter crew ‘a family man,’ son says",11780,US,True,0.0,"The headline mentions the 'Dayton man' and the 'jail inmate litter crew,' but it does not explicitly mention the drivers of the vehicles involved in the crash.",1.0,The headline refers to the 'Dayton man' and 'jail inmate litter crew' using human terms.

The panorama clip from her son Johnathon Kurth, sent the day before, showed “some kind of event place” with a big TV screen, but it was shot so fast it was hard to tell at first where or what he was doing.

It was the Haymarket's Railyard, Karr would later discover, the same place Cassie Brenner had been hanging out with friends on a Husker gameday before heading out to the bars.

Nick Bisesi had been downtown, too, meeting up with his sister and brother-in-law at a dance club after a day of tailgating with friends and family.

At some point, Brenner, Kurth, Bisesi and three others — Octavias Farr, Jonathan Koch and Ben Lenagh — piled into Kurth’s black 2020 Honda Accord and barreled down Randolph Street, their lives forever linked.

A week later, there are more questions than answers about how and why the car careened off the street east of 56th Street and Cotner Boulevard and into a tree just after 2 a.m. Oct. 2, killing all six occupants in what Lincoln police officials have described as “the worst crash in Lincoln in recent memory.”

“It’s all speculation,"" Karr said in a phone interview with the Journal Star after she traveled to Lincoln following the crash. ""What were they doing over there?""

Five of the victims were from Lincoln, while Lenagh was from Omaha.

Lincoln Police have said little publicly about their investigation into the crash and what led up to it, much of which remains unclear, even to investigators, who were not available for interviews.

“In most crashes we investigate, there’s someone that’s either a witness or involved that we can get some details from,” Capt. Todd Kocian said Wednesday. “Unfortunately, in this case, we do not have that.”

None of the back seat passengers — Bisesi, Lenagh, Koch and Brenner — were buckled in at the time of the crash, police said in the crash report filed Monday. Both Kurth and Farr, the front-seat passenger, were wearing seat belts when the Honda hopped a curb, struck a mailbox and crashed into the tree at an ""unknown high rate of speed,” investigators said in the crash report.

Randolph, essentially a minor east-west arterial from between Capitol Parkway and 56th, transitions to a curving neighborhood street east of 56th and dead-ends at Taylor Park, a half-mile from the crash site.

The posted speed limit on Randolph where the crash occurred is 25 mph.

“We’re safe to say speed appears to be a factor in the crash,” Kocian said.

Still, police don’t know exactly how fast the Accord was going, whether drugs or alcohol played a role, whether the driver was distracted or whether the vehicle malfunctioned ahead of the tragic crash.

“These are questions we don’t know the answer to,” Kocian said. “Because, again, we don’t have anybody we can interview. So it’s going to be kind of a battle to figure out exactly what happened. And, quite honestly, we might not know.

“Sometimes you don’t have all the pieces of the puzzle.”

Mo Eisenhauer stayed in that Saturday night but kept up with Brenner, her best friend who was celebrating the Nebraska football team’s victory against Indiana in downtown Lincoln.

“She texted me and she was, like, ‘Hey, are you out?’” Eisenhauer recalled in an interview with the Journal Star. “I told her, ‘No, I didn’t end up going to the Railyard or anything; I stayed at home and watched the game.’

“She was, like, ‘OK, well, I’m at the Railyard now. We’re probably gonna head to bars after.’”

Eisenhauer didn’t hear from Brenner again until 12:30 a.m., when the 24-year-old and her roommates — Koch, 22, and Farr, 21 — were at least starting to think about their route home.

“Do you need a way home?"" Eisenhauer says she asked Brenner.

“And she was, like, ‘No, I think (Farr) and the others are leaving here soon, so I’ll probably just get an Uber with Octo (Farr) and the rest of the boys.’”

She didn’t.

Instead, the three roommates — along with Bisesi, 22, and Lenagh, 23 — ultimately climbed into the car with Kurth, who Eisenhauer said was an acquaintance of their friend group.

At 2:16 a.m., the Honda smashed into the tree outside Brad Bartak’s home on Randolph Street, where he's lived since 1971. He used a rock to break the car’s back window and a garden hose to douse a fire emerging from the engine as first responders rushed to the scene, unsure of what they would find.

It was, at first, unclear how many passengers had been in the car, and whether any were in the car when area residents began calling to report the collision, according to archived emergency scanner traffic.

“(Callers) are unable to locate occupants,” a dispatcher said, later adding that bystanders, with their view shielded by the sedan's curtain airbags, couldn’t tell if there was anyone inside the car at all.

But soon, the devastation became more clear.

“Three or four teenagers in the vehicle,” dispatchers relayed, sending more Lincoln Fire and Rescue responders to the scene, 29 in total.

“They are all unconscious,” a dispatcher said.

Crews extricated the back seat passengers first. Then came Farr. Then Kurth.

Brenner, they said, was the only one still breathing when they reached her. Medics rushed her to a hospital, but the Lincoln woman died late that morning.

The five others died at the scene.

“It hurts,"" said Misty Goeden, Koch’s aunt who said the 22-year-old was like another son to her. ""It hurts to think you’ll never see them again.”

Chris Mannel, a crash reconstructionist who spent 15 years in law enforcement, said ""there's no doubt speed was involved,"" in a crash of this magnitude.

""You really don't see those sorts of injuries if you don't have speed involved,"" said Mannel, whose company, Nebraska Crash Reconstruction, does consulting work for insurance companies and attorneys while also collecting crash data. ""If a car were to hit a building or something else, it would give way ... but a tree, it doesn't move.""

Six killed in crash

Six people died on the morning of Oct. 2 when a sedan crashed into a tree on Randolph Street near 56th in east Lincoln.
Lincoln Journal Star

The car's airbag module — sometimes called the ""black box"" — would likely be key to the investigation, especially if there is no video of the crash or witnesses, Mannel said.

The module can provide insight in how fast the car was going in the preceding seconds, but Mannel said it's possible the box was damaged by either the impact or when the car started on fire.

Investigators could also conduct a crush analysis that can measure the extent of the impact and compare it with data from crash tests, according to Mannel. That could ""give you a ballpark figure of how fast they were going,"" he said.

But some questions may simply be unanswerable.

""Obviously, in the years I was still in law enforcement, that's what the family wanted — were the reasons and the answers,"" Mannel said.

Karr said police believe there may be a video of the crash captured by a doorbell camera, but for the most part, details she's been supplied have been few and far between.

The Eastridge neighborhood in east Lincoln where the crash took place is “nowhere near John’s apartment,” according to his mother, who added that she didn’t know anybody else in the vehicle.

Kurth had moved from western Nebraska to Lincoln to work for BNSF Railway.

“I knew he was trying to put himself out there and meet people,” she said. “He didn’t have family here.”

Kurth would drink on occasion, but Karr said she never saw her son intoxicated.

People gather and lay mementos and flowers Monday at the foot of a tree on Randolph Street, the scene of a fatal crash that killed six people on Oct. 2.
KENNETH FERRIERA, Journal Star

Karr suggested her son may not have been familiar with the complicated intersection where 56th and Randolph streets and Cotner Boulevard converge.

Kurth, she added, may not have known Randolph begins to curve sharply east of 56th, where the ring of bouquets and mementos flanking the crash site continues to grow.

Mourners can be seen contemplating the scene daily, the tree's stripped bark a bleak reminder of that day and the questions that remain.

(WSMV) - Three people were killed on Saturday after a train crashed into a vehicle in Marshall County.

22-year-old Duvraska Coronado, 26-year-old Magyory Coronado and 29-year-old Welengang Coronado, all of Nashville were killed.

According to a GoFundMe set up by the boyfriend of Duvraska, the three killed were siblings. Francisco Torres, the creator of the GoFundMe set it up to raise money for their parents to say goodbye to their children. The money would help the mother travel from Venezuela to Nashville and help cover their funeral expenses. Torres said the goal was to raise $36,000.

The accident happened at the overpass on Depot Street around 1:30 p.m. where the car was pushed about 600 yards down the track.

One neighbor saw it all. For more than 20 years Steffon Crutcher said he has lived along the railroad tracks and heard the sound of rattling metal and horns as daily background noise, but what he heard and saw Saturday left him and his son in shock.

“My son and I were watching the game right here in my shed and we just heard a loud bang,” said Crutcher. “It was louder than a normal train going down the track.”

When Crutcher looked out he saw a lot of smoke coming from the train. At first, he thought it was mechanical issues until emergency crews rushed to the tracks.

While troopers say three are dead, Crutcher said this isn’t the first time something like this has happened.

“It has happened since I’ve been here, a couple of times at this particular crossing that I know of,” said Crutcher.

Crutcher said it’s a switching system with no gates and sometimes two trains coming down the tracks at the same time.

“I’ve lived here all my life and the things that I see now just coming through this area right here, it’s a lot busier a lot heavier and there should be something done to make people more aware of the situation with the tracks,” said Crutcher.

Now neighbors are praying this tragedy pushes officials to make a change.

Police said 11 people were injured in a collision on the Flixborough Industrial Estate on Saturday night, including four people seriously hurt, one critically.

A witness said: ""All of a sudden there was a big bang. We saw a woman go flying off the bonnet of the car and end up underneath it. It was like a horror scene, something I never want to see again."" A 17-year-old has been arrested on suspicion of causing serious injury by dangerous driving.

However, police stressed today that their investigations were at an early stage and appealed for witnesses to come forward. Pictures shared with Scunthorpe and Grimsby Live showed a police cordon and a damaged red car, thought to be a Ford Fiesta, at the scene of the accident.

Police retained a presence on the estate this morning, where tyre marks, debris and other evidence of an accident could be seen. The witness, who asked not to be named, said the event, called the Scunthorpe Car Meet, had ""started well"" at the M&S car park in the town, where various tyre marks could be seen on Sunday.

Vehicles then moved to the Flixborough estate where he described some drivers ""getting carried away and showing off"". A second man who spoke to Scunthorpe and Grimsby Live said he had heard a loud band and then rushed to check on injured people. He said: ""We heard a massive bang, I thought it was a pop from a car at first, but as soon as someone said there'd been a crash we went straight over.

""It was a horrible shock to see so many people lying about injured, and everyone rushed over to help when we realised what was happening."" He added: ""We went over to two kids to make sure they were alright, they couldn't have been any older than six.""

Scunthorpe and Grimsby Live understands organisers of the meet have told motorists they will no longer be staging events. Other witnesses spoke of their sadness following the incident. One enthusiast said he had enjoyed attending the events with his partner in order to see other cars and chat to the owners about the modifications they had made.

He said the car scene had been ""ruined"" and added: ""It’s a really sad day for Scunthorpe."" Emergency services were called to the incident at around 9.10pm on Saturday, September 25. A number of people were taken to hospital and were described as being in ""a stable but serious condition"".

Inspector John Rickells said: “This is a multi-agency major incident response and we are working with our emergency service colleagues to provide emergency first aid and establish the circumstances of the incident. As part of our investigations, a 17-year-old has been arrested on suspicion of causing serious injury by dangerous driving.

""At this time our investigations are at a really early stage, and we will release more information when we are able to do so. We are aware that a number of people left the scene prior to emergency services arriving, and they may have witnessed what happened.

""We would ask that anyone who may have mobile phone /dashcam footage of the vehicles involved both prior to and at the time of the collision to contact us so that we can establish exactly how the incident happened.""

Earlier this year, the enthusiasts behind the car meet events had insisted they were not ""boy racers"" and instead gathered to show ""each other’s pride and joy for cars"". At the time, organiser Josh Windle said: ""I know we get put underneath the category 'boy racers' as there is always the odd person that performs stupid moves with burnouts, drifting, and speeding. But the rules are put out there to not do this on our [social media] pages.

""I tend to stay away from residential areas ... it’s not just young people it’s people of all ages that attend from the young to middle age and the older ones. We hate being called boy racers. It’s our hobby and yes, we get the odd one that performs something stupid and if it’s seen by the police they will get offences for it.""

Police arrested a 17-year-old boy on suspicion of causing serious injury by dangerous driving. He has been released under investigation.

Connor Richards, of Sheffield, was taken to hospital following the collision in Flixborough industrial estate, near Scunthorpe, but died of his injuries on Thursday.

Police said one other victim was still in hospital and was in a stable condition.

Others who were taken to hospital had now been discharged.

Eleven bystanders were injured when a Ford Fiesta ploughed into a crowd, including children as well as a pregnant woman. Emergency services were called to the scene.

A video clip showed a person sitting on the rear spoiler of a BMW wheel-spinning in a car park, where the meet originally gathered. Skidmarks were left.

A witness described some drivers “getting carried away and showing off”.

A separate clip from later in the day appeared to show a person being carried on the bonnet of a red car that was braking heavily.

One of the wounded, Georgia Wood, 22, lost her unborn baby and suffered a bleed on the brain.

Humberside Police said officers were still investigating. The force said: “We have gathered a huge amount of footage and information following the collision.

“However, if anyone has footage that they have not provided to the police, we urge them to get in touch on our non-emergency number 101 quoting log 531 of 24 September.”

Metro Nashville Police Department officers responded to the scene around 9:30 a.m. Wednesday.

Police say that Amber Brockett, 40, was driving and attempted to make a left turn onto Old Hickory Boulevard West in a Volkswagen Jetta.

As Brockett attempted the turn, a Honda CRV, driven by 24-year-old James Jones, struck the back of the Jetta at a high rate of speed.

The force of the collision caused the Jetta to crash into a Chevrolet Avalanche in the next lane. After colliding with the Avalanche, the Jetta entered the intersection and struck a Ford F-150 truck.

Officials report that the drivers of the Avalanche and F-150 refused medical treatment.

Brockett was transported to Skyline Medical Center after the crash, where she died. Brockett was a nurse at Skyline. She was on her way home from work at the time of the wreck.

Jones was transported to Skyline Medical Center with non-life threatening injuries. A search warrant was obtained for Jones' blood following the discovery of evidence of impairment.

Jones will be charged with vehicular homicide by intoxication, three counts of aggravated assault by recklessness, reckless endangerment, felon in possession of a weapon, possession of a weapon under the influence and no proof of insurance following his release from the hospital.

At least 15 people were injured Friday evening after a rideshare driver carrying a passenger crashed into an Arlington, Virginia, pub and caused a structure fire, police said. Nine patients were transported to area hospitals, according to the Arlington County Police Department. Six patients were treated for non-life-threatening injuries. An additional six patients were treated and released at the scene, police said. As of Monday, three people were still hospitalized. One is in critical condition and the other two are stable, police said.  Police do not believe the driver acted intentionally and have ruled out alcohol as a contributing factor, the Arlington County Police Department said in a release Monday.  The crash took place at Ireland’s Four Courts pub and restaurant in the 2000 block of Wilson Boulevard, according to police. Affiliate WJLA said it happened about 6:45 p.m. According to police, the preliminary investigation indicates the driver of the vehicle, who was a rideshare driver and had a passenger at the time of accident, was traveling northbound on North Courthouse Road when the vehicle crashed into the restaurant. The driver and the passenger were both transported to the hospital with non-life threatening injuries. The restaurant issued a statement Friday evening saying it was “devastated” by the accident. “Undoubtedly, the decisive actions of the arriving officers to run directly into the building and remove patrons saved lives,” said Police Chief Andy Penn in a statement. “During a developing emergency incident where seconds count, the men and women of the Arlington County Police Department exemplified their professionalism and unwavering commitment to providing the highest level of police services and I couldn’t be prouder of their response,” Penn continued. The structure fire was extinguished, according to a tweet from the Arlington County Fire Department. Building engineers “evaluated the structure and determined it was structurally sound but could not be reoccupied,” Arlington police said on social media. An investigation into the crash remains ongoing, police said. “The driver of the vehicle is cooperating with the investigation,” the police department said Monday.

The suspect was booked into jail on suspicion of failing to remain at the scene of a crash involving a death, police say. The Salt Lake Tribune generally does not name suspects unless they’ve been charged with a crime.

On Wednesday night, the boy and his mother were walking south on 4000 West near 4200 South in West Valley City when a vehicle ran up onto the sidewalk and struck the child, according to police. The vehicle did not stop.

The boy died at a hospital a short time later.

Traffic investigators narrowed down the vehicle description to a silver Toyota Tacoma and tracked its general whereabouts prior to the wreck, according to the release.

Police talked with neighbors north of where the crash occurred and informed them of the vehicle description. Just before midnight on Thursday, one of them reported seeing the vehicle park and a man and woman walking away from it, the news release states.

Investigators followed up and found damage on the vehicle consistent with the hit-and-run.

They tracked the suspect to a house near 4000 West 3700 South and determined that he was behind the wheel when the crash occurred, the release states.

The child has not been identified by West Valley City police.

(KPTV) - A school bus driver for Salem-Keizer Public Schools was arrested for driving under the influence while transporting students, according to the Salem Police Department.

Katy Anne Fowler, 42, was arrested Thursday for 15 counts of reckless endangering, DUII, reckless driving, and criminal mischief.

Police said the investigation began after the department received reports that Fowler was under the influence of alcohol while driving students on Aug. 9. Fowler was reportedly driving 15 students on two separate bus routes between 7 a.m. and 10 a.m. on that day, taking students to and from summer programs.

According to police, Fowler was driving the bus between the two transports and struck a guard rail. No kids were on board at the time of the crash. Reports say she took a breathalyzer test at about 11 a.m. and showed an alcohol level of .063%.

Michael Thomas, a district parent, said he’s concerned with how the school handles its interview process for bus drivers.

“It’s very dangerous,” Thomas said. “How are they making sure that our kids are actually safe when they’re being transported to and from school.”

The school district said Fowler passed a criminal finger print background check with the Oregon Department of Education, but according to court records, she has previous convictions in California for driving with a suspended license, refusal to take a blood alcohol test, public intoxication and allowing an unlicensed minor to drive.

“We all do make mistakes,” Thomas said. “But I feel like if there is anything questionable, on your record - well multiple - then yeah no.”

The district said the safety of students are their top priority and that Fowler is currently on leave.

Any parents, students, or community members who may have witness Fowler driving the bus on Aug. 9 is asked to call the police department’s traffic team at 503-588-6171.","A school bus driver for Salem-Keizer Public Schools was arrested for driving under the influence while transporting students, according to the Salem Police Department.",11712,US,True,1.0,"The headline references the school bus driver and the 15 students on board, which are the key parties involved in the incident as described in the article body.",1.0,"The headline refers to the school bus driver as a 'school bus driver' and the students as '15 students on board,' both of which are human terms.",1.0,"The headline uses active voice by stating 'accused of driving drunk,' clearly showing the action performed by the school bus driver.",Salem-Keizer school bus driver endangered 15 students by driving drunk,"The headline now mentions the driver, Katy Anne Fowler, and the 15 students involved in the incident.","The headline refers to the 'school bus driver' as a human, Katy Anne Fowler, and the 'students' as humans, not just transportation modes.","The headline uses active voice, showing that Katy Anne Fowler endangered the 15 students by driving drunk.",True,11712,"[{'id': 28819, 'groupid': None, 'transportationmode': 10, 'health': 1, 'child': 0, 'underinfluence': 1, 'hitrun': 0}]",0,1,0,0

Nicole Lorraine Linton, 37, was taken into custody at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Westwood, the CHP said in a news release.

Charges of vehicular manslaughter with gross negligence will be recommended when the case is presented to the Los Angeles County district attorney's office, the Highway Patrol said.

Earlier Friday morning, authorities identified a pregnant woman and her unborn child as two of the six victims who were killed in the collision.

Los Angeles County coroner's officials said Asherey Ryan and her unborn son died in the incident.

The coroner's office did not immediately release the names of the other four deceased victims, but described them as a boy, whose age was not specified, two women and a man.

The young child who died was Asherey Ryan's son, her sister said Friday in an interview with our sister station, Eyewitness News in Los Angeles.

""I drove to the scene,"" Ryan's sister said. ""I ran past the police officers just because I wanted to feel her energy one more time.

""Yesterday, I truly lost it,"" she said. ""My family was broken yesterday. And we're still broken.""

Shortly after 1:30 p.m. Thursday, a Mercedes-Benz coupe caused a crash involving as many as six cars near a gas station, according to the California Highway Patrol.

Several people were ejected from the cars and two vehicles caught fire. News video from the scene showed the charred and mangled cars, as well as a child's car seat among the debris covering the street.

Surveillance showed the Mercedes careening through an intersection, striking at least two cars that exploded in flames and were sent hurtling onto a sidewalk, winding up against the gas station's corner sign. A fiery streak led to one car. One vehicle was sheared in half.

""It looked like the whole intersection from corner to corner was on fire,"" said witness Harper Washington. ""A lot of sparks and electricity. I was under the impression that, really at first I thought they dropped a bomb on us. I thought another world war had started. Then I realized it was a car into the sign.""

""Once the fire went away and the booming left, I realized it was two cars there. You could see the people on fire and that's just sad. I really pray for the people and the community.""

Seven injured people were taken to the hospital, including the woman who was driving the Mercedes. Her injuries were described as non-life-threatening.

The other victims had minor injuries and included a 33-year-old woman and six children ranging in age from 13 months old to 15 years old, CHP Officer Franco Pepi said.

Witness Alphonso Word choked up as he described seeing the pregnant woman and a child in the immediate aftermath of the crash.

""It hurts. It does,"" Word said. ""Because I have a grandson. I know people that have kids.

The boy has not yet been publicly identified. 

Trooper Robert Reyer said the cyclist was using a crosswalk with blinking signals near Pacific Avenue and 134th Street South at about 4:04 p.m. when a 27-year-old Lakewood woman driving north in a Jeep Wrangler went through the crosswalk and struck the boy. “He all of the sudden appeared in front of her car, and she was unable to stop,” Reyer said. 

Witnesses reported that the crosswalk signals were activated. It has signals on both sides of the road and at a center island. When collision investigators inspected the scene, the center signal was not working. Reyer said it was unclear whether it worked when the crash occurred. 

The cause of the crash was the Jeep driver failing to yield to the bicyclist, according to WSP. Troopers said the driver would not face criminal charges for the deadly crash. The driver also did not receive a ticket. 

“Charges would only be forwarded if there was a criminal offense, such as being impaired and killing somebody, or driving in a manner that is, basically, reckless,” Reyer said. “We could completely exclude both. There was no impairment, and there was no reckless driving.” 

A car ahead of the Jeep had stopped at the crosswalk before the collision, according to troopers, and witnesses reported that other northbound and southbound traffic had stopped. A trooper who was on the scene told Reyer that it was very likely the driver did not see the bicyclist enter the crosswalk because of the car stopped in front of her. 

The roadway was closed for about two-and-a-half hours while crews investigated the incident. 

Reyer advised drivers to be very cautious, especially during summer months when more pedestrians, bicyclists and motorcycle riders are out and about. 

“All of them are rather difficult to see because they are not as big as a car and they are a lot more vulnerable because they don’t have that metal cage around them that protects them a little bit better,” he said.","A 13-year-old boy crossing Pacific Avenue in Parkland on a bicycle was hit and killed by a vehicle Tuesday afternoon, according to the Washington State Patrol.",11845,US,True,1.0,The headline references all key parties involved in the crash: the 13-year-old on a bike and the vehicle (Jeep Wrangler).,0.0,"The headline refers to the 13-year-old as a '13-year-old with bike' which is not a human term, and the vehicle is mentioned as 'vehicle' instead of the driver.",0.0,The headline uses passive construction ('killed in vehicle collision') which obscures agency.,Driver strikes and kills 13-year-old boy crossing Pacific Ave. in Parkland,"The original headline mentioned the 13-year-old, the bike, and the vehicle.

But in surrounding areas and on more rural roads, the congestion from the closures took a toll.

Rockport Fire Chief Damon Dyer was on scene in the moments after the crash, working all 5 accidents that stopped both lanes of I-30 for hours. He said he had never seen anything like it – one minor accident likely caused by the weather turning into a massive, fiery pileup, crushing eight tractor trailers, and taking the lives of three people.

“In 21 years as a firefighter, this was the worst accident I’ve seen,” Dyer exclaimed. “I was really amazed that we only lost three people in it. The potential for 15, 16 people was there.”

A day later, he’s taken only a short break, back out at the Rockport on-ramp assisting ASP and other agencies as they work to deal with more than a day’s work of backup.

“We’re just trying to keep this road open for the residents that need to get through,” Dyer said, as he and two others directed traffic, “and then everybody trying to shortcut through the back roads.”

Just a few miles away in the center of Malvern, police officers and state troopers must direct traffic by hand, trying to keep the flow going as 18-wheelers search for a way around the main route. With the highway closed, it was one of the only ways large trailers could get to their destination, seeking AR highways and alternate routes over the blocked-up highway.

ARDOT crews have since been working overnight and all day trying to clear the road and re-pave the damaged asphalt. Midday Thursday, they opened up the inside lane near the accident to keep traffic moving, and were working on opening up the other side a few hours later.

Shortly after 6 p.m., ARDOT announced that all lanes of traffic on westbound I-30 have been re-opened.",Traffic in one direction of I-30 was blocked outside of Malvern after a fiery crash involving at least eight 18-wheelers took the life of at least 4 people.,11808,US,True,0.0,The headline mentions 'victims' but does not specify who the victims are or any other parties involved in the crash.,1.0,"The headline uses the term 'victims,' which is a human term.",0.0,"The headline uses passive voice with 'identify victims,' which obscures agency.",Arkansas authorities identify motorists killed in fiery I-30 crash involving tractor-trailer drivers,The original headline only mentioned 'victims' and 'authorities.'

According to the Washington State Patrol (WSP), authorities were informed of the accident at 6:24 p.m. on May 26, 2022. They learned that a Moses Lake man driving a pickup truck and trailer was headed northbound on State Route 17 with five other drivers stopped at the intersection.

The truck driver allegedly ran a red light and struck an Arlington, WA man who rightfully entered the roadway.

Patrol officers responded to a crash involving multiple cars on the Glenn between Turpin and Muldoon roads around 5:50 p.m., the Anchorage Police Department said in an alert Friday night. A preliminary investigation indicated that a red Dodge Challenger and a black Mitsubishi Galant traveling inbound on the Glenn both lost control, and the Dodge hit a tree by the highway, police said. The two people in that vehicle were taken to the hospital with injuries that police described as not life-threatening.

The Mitsubishi hit a black Toyota Tundra pickup that was also inbound, and both vehicles “crossed the median into the outbound lanes of the Glenn Highway” and rolled, police said. The Mitsubishi then hit a silver Chevy Silverado that was outbound from Anchorage in oncoming traffic, and both vehicles caught fire, according to police.

The driver of the Mitsubishi and a passenger were pronounced dead at the scene while the Chevy’s driver -- its sole occupant -- wasn’t hurt, police said.

The two people in the Toyota Tundra sustained non-life-threatening injuries and were also taken to the hospital, police said.

The deceased will be identified once next of kin have been notified, according to police, who said that no one had been arrested as of late Friday night.

The U.S. Army Alaska said in a written statement Saturday that two soldiers were killed and another two were injured in a Glenn Highway crash Friday. Of the two injured, one had been released from the hospital as of Saturday while the other remained at Providence Alaska Medical Center, the U.S. Army Alaska said.

Northbound and southbound lanes of the highway between Muldoon Road and Boniface Parkway were closed for several hours while crash investigators processed the scene. The highway reopened around 3:30 a.m. Saturday, according to police.

Alec, 23, suffered a traumatic brain injury and died at the Royal Stoke University Hospital the following day on May 2. Dad Paul said: ""I drove at no more than 30mph as we had lambs in the back and I pulled over at one point to allow other vehicles to overtake and several cars passed me and the road behind me became clear.

Alec Heyworth, 23, was hit by an Audi A3 on May 1 as he attempted to cross the A532 at Rushton Spencer, near Leek. The young farmer was thrown into the air before landing on his head. Alec suffered a traumatic brain injury and died at the Royal Stoke University Hospital the following day, Stoke-on-Trent Live reports.

Alec's father Paul saw the entire incident. In the build-up to the collision, Alec had been in the passenger seat of a Ford Ranger when his dad pulled over on the A523 in Rushton Spencer. The pair were there to transfer some lambs into a field that they were towing in a trailer.

Alec exited the passenger's side and walked around the front before stepping into the road, but was hit by the Audi, which was overtaking on the 60mph stretch.

In a statement, read out at the hearing, Alec's father Paul Heyworth said: ""I drove at no more than 30mph as we had lambs in the back and I pulled over at one point to allow other vehicles to overtake and several cars passed me and the road behind me became clear.

In a statement, the Audi driver said he saw the Ford Ranger and that it appeared to be an ""unattended vehicle"".

""I could see there was a pick up truck,"" he said. ""There was no movement and I could see no drivers. It was just a parked and unattended vehicle as far as I could tell.

""I moved over on to the opposite side of the road to overtake and started to move back over to complete the manoeuvre. As I started to pull back over a male was in the road and put his hands out and jumped up, but it was already too late and he struck the front of my car.""

A police investigation found there were no vehicle faults with the Audi A3 and that there was a possibility that neither the Audi driver nor Alec could see one another. Speaking at the inquest collision investigator PC Roger Wetton explained that it was not possible to say what speed the Audi was driving at.

Alec, from Smallwood, grew up on his family's farm and attended Smallwood Primary School and Holmes Chapel Secondary School. The inquest heard he did an apprenticeship to become a chef for two years before deciding to work with his father on their farm.

His father Paul said: ""He was a worker, he worked six days a week from 9am until 9pm and every Sunday morning. He enjoyed manual labour.

""He was in a relationship with his girlfriend and they had been together for the last seven years. They had recently talked about wanting to get married, plans to start a family and she lived with us at the farm since pretty much the beginning of their relationship.""

A cause of death was provided as 1A traumatic brain injury caused by 1B road traffic collision. Area coroner Emma Serrano concluded that Alec died as a result of a traumatic brain injury after being struck by a vehicle on the road that he was hit.

(WSMV) - People who work in Lebanon Square remain rattled after a mother was killed by a driver, who police said was impaired, on Monday evening.

According to Lebanon Police on Facebook, just before 5 p.m., a gray SUV struck another vehicle near the intersection of W. Main and N. Greenwood Streets. Investigators said the SUV failed to stop and continued eastbound towards the Lebanon Town Square, two blocks away from the intersection.

Witnesses told police that the SUV did not appear to brake as it entered the roundabout portion of the square, striking a tan four-door sedan, then stopped near the monument at the center of the square. In contrast, police said the sedan came to rest on the southeast side of the roundabout.

“The velocity of that accident was horrific. Probably a hundred feet that car was knocked,” Frank Lannom, who witnessed the crash, said.

Police said responders immediately rendered medical attention to the sedan driver, 27-year-old Ashley Brewer-Bailey and her 3-year-old son Colson.

“We tried to keep his attention and talk to him,” Lannom said. “The best he could do was tell us he was three.”

EMS transported both the woman and child to a trauma center, where police said the female driver was later pronounced dead. The child has since been released from the hospital, according to police.

Police identified the driver of the SUV as 70-year-old Sandra Lee Strickland, of Lebanon. Police said Strickland was found to be driving impaired based on the results of field sobriety tests given on-scene.

Strickland was charged with DUI first-degree and Vehicular Homicide by Intoxication. Police said there could be additional charges.

“We come to work here every day, travel these roads, don’t expect something like this to happen at the local square,” Lannom said.

The female driver of the first vehicle struck near N. Greenwood St. was checked out by medical personnel on the scene and released.

Lannom said he believes the child survived thanks to the car seat.

Metro Nashville Police said the crash happened on the 7300 block of Highway 100 near Edwin Warner Park on Friday afternoon. The victim is identified as 65-year-old John E. Taylor, of Nashville.

The investigation shows that 22-year-old Jenna Capraro, of Fairview, rear-ended Taylor's car when he had slowed or stopped to make a left turn. Police say the impact pushed him into a lane of traffic where another car hit his car on the passenger side.

Taylor died shortly after arriving at the hospital after being ejected from the vehicle, police say. He was not wearing a seat belt.

Melissa Keilloh, 20, was charged with causing the death of 17-year-old Phoebe Johnson while over the drink-drive limit.

The teenage girl's parents also sobbed as they watched her friend in the courtroom. Keilloh from Hartshorne is accused of being behind the wheel of a red Seat Leon which came off the A514 near Ticknall early on Saturday, October 23, 2021. The car crashed at around 12.30am, killing Miss Johnson, from Swadlincote, and also injuring another 17-year-old girl.

Keilloh sat with her mother for support during the hearing at South Derbyshire Magistrates' Court and was also joined by other family members. The 20-year-old held back years to confirm her name, date of birth and address and remained silent as details of the accusation against her were read out, Derbyshire Live reports.

The charge alleges that Keilloh, who was 19 at the time of the crash, had been between 97 and 149 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood at the time of the crash, when the legal limit is 80 milligrams.

In a short hearing on Thursday, September 29, Freddie Sail, prosecuting, said: ""Unfortunately the circumstances of this collision were that Phoebe Johnson lost her life on October 23, last year. It is a matter that can only be dealt with at the Crown Court. I ask that the charge be sent to the Crown Court. I am content for unconditional bail.""

Finn Butler, mitigating, made no representations. District Judge Andrew Meachin granted Keilloh, of Brookdale Road, Hartshorne, unconditional bail and ordered her to appear at Derby Crown Court at 9.30am on Thursday, October 27, 2022.

He said: ""This case can only be dealt with at the Crown Court. You must be there on October 27, at 9.30am. If you are late, that is an offence.""

The incident closed the A514 between Stanton by Bridge and Ticknall for a number of hours. Debris from the car was found in a walkway next to the road following the incident, with a hole in the hedge left from where the car came off the road.

Following an inquest hearing in November 2 last year, Pheobe's parents, Nicky and Paul Johnson, said: ""Phoebe was loved by many and we would like to thank our family and friends for their support, messages, condolences and love at this very difficult time. The pain is relentless but we have found comfort in the people that knew and loved Phoebe.""

Amrit Virk, director of curriculum at Burton and South Derbyshire College, which Miss Johnson attended, said after the crash: ""We were incredibly saddened to hear of Phoebe’s passing. She was very well-liked by all of the College students and staff that knew her and we send our sincere condolences to her family and all of her friends.""

A tribute on a Go Fund Me page, which raised money toward a commemorative bench in Swadlincote said Miss Johnson has a ""knack of making you smile"". It added: ""She had a huge impact on everyone's life and her smile would light up any room. There are so many lovely friends and family that are going to miss her tremendously, so this will help as a remembrance in the years to come.""","Pheobe Johnson, 17, died in the crash last year",11757,GB,True,1.0,The headline references both the accused ('Woman') and the victim ('friend').,1.0,The headline refers to all involved parties using human terms ('Woman' and 'friend').,0.0,The headline uses passive construction ('is accused of killing') which obscures agency.,Melissa Keilloh weeps in court as she faces charges for killing friend Phoebe Johnson in crash,"The headline now mentions Melissa Keilloh, Phoebe Johnson, and the other 17-year-old girl (implied by 'killing friend').",The headline uses 'Melissa Keilloh' and 'Phoebe Johnson' instead of referring to them as transportation modes or abstract terms.,The headline uses active voice by clearly stating what Melissa Keilloh did ('weeps in court as she faces charges') and what she is accused of doing ('killing friend Phoebe Johnson in crash').,True,11757,"[{'id': 28921, 'groupid': None, 'transportationmode': 5, 'health': 2, 'child': 0, 'underinfluence': 0, 'hitrun': 0}, {'id': 28922, 'groupid': None, 'transportationmode': 5, 'health': 3, 'child': 0, 'underinfluence': 0, 'hitrun': 0}, {'id': 28923, 'groupid': None, 'transportationmode': 5, 'health': 1, 'child': 0, 'underinfluence': 0, 'hitrun': 0}]",0,1,1,1

Newcastle Crown Court heard the crash happened on the A183 in Sunderland on October 22 last year. Graeme O'Sullivan, prosecuting, said: ""The defendant drove his car with one passenger, his partner, at excessive speed. He passed straight through a red traffic light at a junction with a roundabout then crashed into a lamp-post.

""This caused extensive damage to the car. The collision caused an injury to his partner.""

The court heard she had to be removed from the car and Wood started pretending he had not been driving. Mr O'Sullivan said: ""He was stood by the car and said he had chanced upon the collision and he was not the driver, notwithstanding the fact it was his girlfriend. He repeated the same to the police.""

The court heard Wood was over the drink drive limit but he was not charged with excess alcohol in time. Mr O'Sullivan said: ""His partner's mobile phone had footage of him driving with one hand on the wheel with both of them drinking from what appeared to be a gin glass or glasses of alcohol. The footage shows him appearing to hold a gin glass moments before the accident.

Wood, 28, of Rosedale Crescent, Houghton-le-Spring, who has no previous convictions, pleaded guilty to causing serious injury by dangerous driving and was sentenced to 15 months suspended for 18 months with 120 hours unpaid work, a £600 fine and a two year driving ban.

Recorder James Wood QC told him: ""You drove at excessive and unlawful speed through a red light at what lay observers thought was 90 to 100mph. You did that with excessive alcohol in your blood but by reason of delay you were not prosecuted for that but I have regard to it.

""You crashed your car into a lamp-post, writing it off and leaving your girlfriend unconscious, with what were thought to be, at the time by those at the scene, catastrophic injuries. In fact, and very luckily for you and her, she only suffered a broken ankle.

""Your partner's mobile phone was examined and it appears at the time you were driving with a glass of alcohol in one hand, obviously not particularly concentrating on the road. You seem in a state of joyful exuberance with her.""

Tony Davis, defending, said the road had a 60mph limit and he was not far in excess of that. He said: ""But he accepts by his plea in those circumstances and prevailing conditions it was too fast and that has caused the collision with the lamp-post.""

Mr Davis added: ""He is a hard-working young man who is providing for four dependants by way of children from his previous relationship, his partner's children, who he treats as his own and she is about to give birth on October 12.

""He has genuine remorse and this was a brief error of judgement. He went out with his girlfriend to pick up a takeaway meal.

""He was not driving greatly in excess of the legal limit for alcohol. The glass in hand is, frankly, not a good feature of this case. She regrets filming him doing it.

""They decided to pick up the takeaway rather than having it delivered. They went a short distance and it was a silly, stupid error which they have both suffered from.""","Dane Wood, of Houghton-le-Spring, was in a state of 'joyful exuberance' but moments later his girlfriend was slumped unconscious and injured",11776,GB,True,1.0,The headline references the driver ('driver') and the partner ('partner') involved in the crash.,1.0,The headline refers to the driver and partner using human terms ('driver' and 'partner').,1.0,The headline uses active voice to describe the actions of the driver ('sipping alcohol moments before crashing and injuring partner').,"Driver Dane Wood crashes car into lamp-post, seriously injuring girlfriend while drinking alcohol",The original headline mentioned the driver and his partner.

According to Orem police, the 20-year old suspect was driving a Jeep Cherokee south on State Street late Oct. 15, traveling 68 mph in a 40 mph zone. When the light at 400 South turned yellow, he accelerated to 73 mph. At the same time, a Chevrolet Malibu traveling in the opposite direction was turning left onto 400 South.

According to witnesses, the Jeep was trying to make it through the intersection before the light turned red. The Jeep slowed slightly, but slammed into the Malibu. The Malibu’s driver was injured, and two passengers inside — BYU students Hailee York, 21, of Lehi, and Ashlyn Hanzon, 21, of Pearland, Texas — were killed.

Both women killed were seniors at the university, a spokesperson confirmed. York was majoring in counseling psychology and special education. Hanzon, who recently studied abroad in London, was majoring in exercise science and wellness.

According to a probable cause statement, police obtained a warrant for the Jeep’s event data recorder. The device indicated that the Jeep was traveling 68 mph shortly before the crash and accelerated to 73 mph when the light turned yellow. The suspect slowed to 67 mph about 0.5 seconds before the collision, the device indicated.

Surveillance video from nearby businesses also showed the Jeep traveling “at a high rate of speed,” according to police.

The suspect was taken to Timpanogos Regional Hospital to be treated for his injuries. According to police, he attempted to flee when officers went to his home to arrest him on Wednesday.

He was booked into the Utah County jail for investigation of negligent homicide, negligent collision, driving without a license, speeding and reckless driving. He is being held without bail.

At BYU, York had formed a group of friends “that were second to none,” which included Hanzon, according to a personal obituary.

In the obituary, York’s family described her as a “peacemaker” who “tried to make sure each member of her family and friend groups were included and loved.” She was a talented musician and athlete who “loved adventure” and was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, serving her faith community in many capacities.

A family member has organized a GoFundMe campaign to help with funeral costs for York.

Hanzon had owned her own photography and videography business for five years, according to her LinkedIn profile. On the website for her business, she said, “Ever since I was young I’ve had a camera in my hand and it’s something I love so much.”

She also enjoyed karaoke, boating, hiking, cycling, traveling, cooking and baking, her LinkedIn profile said.

In a Facebook post, a friend of both York and Hanzon who also attended BYU said, “These two gals got me through my freshman year and were there for me through the hardest moments and the loudest laughs.”",A 20-year-old unlicensed driver was arrested after a crash that killed two BYU students.

Linda Trice, 60, later told police she was the driver in the crash, the Metro Nashville Police Department said in a news release. The wreck left 60-year-old Madison resident Stephen Carmon dead.

Trice also faces charges for leaving the scene of a crash involving death and driving on a revoked license, MNPD said. She is being held on a $153,600 bond at the Downtown Detention Center in Nashville and is set to appear before a judge Wednesday, records show. 

How the wreck unfolded 

MNPD investigators believe Trice was driving her Chevrolet Monte Carlo north on Gallatin Pike South in Madison just before 1:30 p.m. Saturday when she drove partially onto the sidewalk. She later told police she swerved when something was thrown at her windshield.

Carmon appeared to be waiting for a city bus at the intersection of Gallatin Pike South and W. Due West Avenue when he was struck, police said. He died at the scene.

Surveillance footage helped lead police to Trice's car, which was later found by officers at an East Webster Street apartment complex, an arrest affidavit showed. As police were examining the car, she approached them and admitted she was the driver in the wreck. 

Trice showed signs of impairment and smelled of alcohol as she spoke to officers, according to MNPD. A sample of her blood will be analyzed for alcohol content by the MNPD crime lab.","Linda Trice, 60, faces a vehicular homicide by intoxication charge after a man in a motorized wheelchair was fatally struck on Saturday, MNPD said.",12018,US,True,1.0,The headline references all key parties involved in the crash: 'woman' (driver) and 'man in wheelchair' (pedestrian).,1.0,The headline refers to all involved parties as humans: 'woman' (driver) and 'man in wheelchair' (pedestrian).,1.0,The headline uses active voice to describe the crash: 'Woman faces vehicular homicide charge after man in wheelchair fatally struck.',Woman charged with vehicular homicide after striking and killing man in wheelchair,"The original headline mentioned the woman and the man in the wheelchair, but the rewritten headline explicitly states that the woman is charged and the man was killed.","The original headline used 'vehicular homicide' and 'man in wheelchair,' which are more technical.

(WVLT) - Officials with the Knoxville Police Department announced Wednesday that Acting Chief of Police Mark Fortner has accepted Officer Cody Klingmann’s letter of resignation.

Officer Klingmann was the subject of an Internal Affairs investigation into the fatal crash that occurred on the morning of August 13, 2021 on Kingston Pike near Papermill Drive.

Mauricio Luna, 27, was pulling onto Kingston Pike near Papermill Drive when he was hit by Officer Cody Klingmann, according to a release from KPD Public Information Officer Scott Erland. Representatives with the Tennessee Highway Patrol, who investigated the crash, told WVLT News that Klingmann was not wearing a seatbelt at the time of the collision.

Officer Klingmann had been reassigned from patrol and remained on reassignment until his resignation. At the time of his resignation, a pre-disciplinary hearing was scheduled based on the findings of the internal investigation, officials said.

The mother of a man who was struck and killed is now suing the officer and city of Knoxville for $3 million, according to court documents obtained by WVLT News.

Luna’s mother, Claudia Macias, filed the suit with attorneys T. Scott Jones and Chris Beavers. Macias claimed she’s owed the money to cover funeral expenses and damages for the loss of life, according to the documents.

The court documents alleged that Klingmann was also not using his emergency lights prior to the crash, which occurred around 3 a.m. before the sun had risen. Klingmann was also traveling at 90 miles per hour before slowing to 81 miles per hour at the time of the crash, the documents said.

The filing also alleged that the city of Knoxville was negligent in allowing Klingmann to drive the cruiser, saying they “should have known that he was an unsafe driver.”

Een zwarte Audi A4 kwam pijlsnel aangereden en de bestuurder, die volgens de politie dronken was, merkte de bocht veel te laat op. Hij dook zichtbaar in de remmen, maar die actie mocht niet baten: de A4 crashte frontaal en reed de Creating Utopia Tattoo Studio in Stanningley in Leeds (West Yorkshire) volledig aan diggelen.

Amper 30 seconden na de crash kwam er al een politiepatrouille ter plaatse. De agenten baanden zich een weg door een puin om tot bij de chauffeur van de Audi te geraken, maar dat lukte hen aanvankelijk niet. Uiteindelijk werden er andere hulpdiensten bijgeroepen en kon de man naar het ziekenhuis worden gebracht.

He was 38. 

A driver swerved into a group of people trying to fix a flat tire, leaving Alhashimi dead and critically injuring a passenger early Sunday, police said. Ekene Amaefuna, 26, of Nashville, said he drove his Honda Pilot off course when another driver cut him off, according to MNPD.

The crash happened after Marcus Utley, 38, stopped his Honda Fit on I-24 near Murfreesboro Pike. He was working as an Uber driver and asked his two passengers to call for a new driver due to a flat tire. 

Passengers Nathan Hood, 42, and his wife, Samantha Crews-Hood, 42, were greeting their second driver — Alhashimi — on the shoulder when the Pilot SUV rounded a curve into the group. 

Alhashimi died at the scene.

Crews-Hood was taken to Vanderbilt University Medical Center with critical injuries. Her husband was treated and released with minor injuries. Utley suffered minor injuries and was not taken to the hospital. 

Amaefuna was not injured. Police said a witness disputes his claim that he was forced off the road by someone else.

In Braintree, a man was struck and killed by a driver on Interstate 93 southbound near Exit 6, according to Massachusetts State Police spokesman Dave Procopio. Troopers responded around 4:25 a.m. Tuesday.

The man, a 42-year-old Boston resident whose identity has not been released, was found dead at the scene, Procopio wrote in an email to reporters.

Troopers were working to establish a description of the vehicle involved later Tuesday morning.

An investigation indicated the pedestrian entered the highway south of Exit 6 and was struck near “the second and third lanes,” Procopio wrote.

“The vehicle or vehicles that struck the victim did not stop and fled the scene,” Procopio wrote. “The pedestrian was determined to be deceased at the scene.

“The facts and circumstances of the crash, including why the victim was walking on the highway, remain under investigation,” he added.

In Somerville, a 72-year-old pedestrian was struck by a driver before 8:40 p.m. Monday on Route 28, or William McGrath Highway, near the Broadway intersection, Procopio said in a separate email.

The man, a Somerville resident, was brought to a Massachusetts General Hospital with “potentially life-threatening injuries,” according to Procopio.

“I kept asking ‘Are you awake? Are you awake? What’s your name? What’s your name. I need a name.’ But he was just breathing heavy because of what happened,” a clerk who works at a nearby Speedway gas station told WCVB. “He was just traumatized, apparently. A car just hit him.”

Troopers at the scene determined the man was hit as he crossed the highway from east to west.

“At the time he was hit, the pedestrian was apparently coming from the nearby Stop & Shop supermarket and was carrying several bags of groceries,” Procopio wrote.

Authorities said evidence suggests the driver was behind the wheel of a white minivan or SUV.

“The vehicle sustained front-end damage in the crash, including a damaged headlight,” Procopio wrote. “Anyone who sees a vehicle matching this description or has information about this crash is asked to contact State Police-Medford at 781-396-0100.”","A 42-year-old Boston man was killed after he apparently entered Interstate 93 in Braintree early Tuesday morning, police said.",7284,US,True,1.0,"The headline mentions '1 dead' and '1 severely injured', which refers to the two key parties involved in the crashes.",0.0,The headline uses dehumanizing statistics '1 dead' and '1 severely injured' without human context.,0.0,"The headline uses passive constructions 'leave 1 dead, 1 severely injured' which obscures agency.","Driver kills man, severely injures another in separate hit-and-run crashes in Braintree and Somerville","The original headline mentioned '1 dead, 1 severely injured,' which is vague.

Tributes have been paid to cyclist Martyn Gall after his “tragic and unfathomable” death while riding.

The 41-year-old was out riding with a club-mate on November 14 in the West Midlands when both riders were hit by a car. 

Martyn died shortly after while the other rider was taken to hospital with life-threatening injuries. 

A woman in her 20s was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and has been released under investigation, the Daily Record reports. 

Cycling group Boldmere Bullets Collective said: “I'm sure many of you will have already heard the tragic and unfathomable news that local cyclist Martyn Gall died after being hit by the driver of a car on the Alvechurch bypass.  

“He was a very experienced cyclist and a stalwart of the Sette Dodici ride - many of us have shared the road with him at some point. Martyn leaves behind a wife and two young daughters as well as many close friends within our local cycling community.  

“I think all of us share feelings of shock, sadness and anger at such an avoidable and meaningless tragedy.” 

The crash happened on the A441 at Alvechurch in Worcestershire at 8am on Saturday, November 14.

Martyn, who worked in transport, was originally from Cumnock in Ayrshire, Scotland, but moved to Birmingham in 2001.

He was husband to Diane and father to two daughters - Heather, 17, and Olivia, 15.

Birmingham bike shop and social enterprise Gear Up said: “Everyone at Gear Up CC would like to send our heartfelt thoughts and prayers to the family and friends of Martyn Gall who has sadly passed away after being hit by a car while out riding this morning with Sette Dodici. 

“Please ride safe and if you are a car driver please please look out for cyclists! We aren’t just cyclists, we are husbands, wives, dads, sons, daughters.” 

>>> Public opposition to new bike lanes overestimated by 50 per cent, according to study

Juan Tiu-Caxaj, 22, was struck by the driver of a unspecified car on Saturday, Nov. 7 at 1 a.m. as he cycled north on Autumn Avenue, police said on Sunday. The driver was headed westbound on Fulton Street, but, according to police, Tiu-Caxaj “entered the intersection without stopping at the stop sign.”

It is unclear how police determined that. The driver remained on the scene and may, in fact, be the lone witness to the crash.

Tiu-Caxaj was taken to Jamaica Medical Center with head trauma and died on Nov. 14, police said. The Collision Investigation Squad is continuing to investigate, police added. Tiu-Caxaj is the 22nd cyclist to die so far this year, a number that puts the city on pace for a repeat of last year’s bloodiest year for cyclists, when 29 died.

The NYPD announced the latest death on World Day of Remembrance for Road Violence Victims, which honors those who have been killed by drivers and because of poorly designed roads worldwide. In New York, activists with Families for Safe Streets will gather at noon at City Hall for a memorial event.

Tiu-Caxaj’s death was announced on the same day that police reported the death of a Bronx pedestrian. Sonia Sotomayor, 58, was killed by a driver near the intersection of East 180th Street and Southern Boulevard on Saturday at around 7 p.m.

Police released no details except that the driver remained on the scene and was not charged.

Transportation Alternatives Executive Director Danny Harris called both deaths eminently “preventable.”

“With more than 210 people killed in traffic violence so far, 2020 is projected to have the most traffic deaths of any year during Mayor de Blasio’s time in office,” Harris said, adding that both crashes “occurred in parts of the city neglected during Mayor de Blasio’s tenure and Vision Zero program.”

“The location in East New York is a Vision Zero Priority Area, [but] the area lacks the type of protected bike lane infrastructure that has been proven to save lives elsewhere in the city,” Harris said, pointing out that eight of the 22 cyclist fatalities this year occurred in the Bronx. “Yet only three percent of the city’s total protected bike lane mileage is in the Bronx, compared to about 50 percent in Manhattan.”

Harris added:

Rather than fight to save human lives and reverse two years of growing deaths from traffic violence, the mayor has slashed the budgets for life-saving programs like Vision Zero, the Green Wave Plan and delayed the roll-out of the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program and the Streets Master Plan. Instead of doing more to save lives, Mayor de Blasio is doing less.

The Department of Transportation is capable of delivering safe streets, but without mayoral leadership that prioritizes human life over the convenience of drivers, New Yorkers will continue to die from traffic violence.","Police are, once again, blaming the victim of a fatal bicycle crash for his own death.",5983,US,True,1.0,"The headline references both the cyclist and the SUV driver, which are the key parties involved in the crash as described in the article body.",1.0,"The headline refers to the cyclist as 'Cyclist' and the driver as 'SUV Driver,' both of which are role-based terms that describe humans.",1.0,The headline uses active voice to describe the crash ('SUV Driver Hits Him').,Driver Hits and Kills Cyclist Juan Tiu-Caxaj; 22nd Cyclist Fatality This Year,"The original headline mentioned the cyclist and the SUV driver.

He also died on scene.

Two people have died after a passenger leaned out the window of a moving car and struck a cyclist. Neither of their identities have been released yet. The driver of the vehicle, identified as 22-year-old Rodrigo Cruz , initially fled the scene but was later taken into custody. The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department called it a “senseless act.” A middle-aged, female cyclist has died after being deliberately struck by a passenger hanging out of the window of a moving vehicle. Both the cyclist and the passenger died at the scene . The act of violence happened around 7:30a.m. Sunday morning in East Las Vegas, along Hollywood Boulevard near Wildcat Way. According to the Las Vegas Review-Journal , the vehicle—a minivan—was driving down Hollywood Boulevard, seemingly racing a few other vehicles. Witnesses reported that the driver of the minivan swerved, and the man in the passenger seat leaned out the window in an attempt to hit two pedestrians, a man and his wife; they saw the van swerve towards them and were able to get out of the way. The driver of the minivan then approached the female cyclist riding in the bike lane, and the passenger leaning out the window collided with her. The cyclist was injured when she fell to the ground and died on the scene, and the passenger fell out of the car. “He traveled along the asphalt for about 150 feet, striking his head on a street light,” Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department homicide lieutenant Ray Spencer said at a press briefing on Sunday afternoon. The cyclist is described as a woman in her mid-50s. The passenger who struck her is described as a male between the ages of 18 and 22. Their identities have not yet been released by the Clark County Coroner’s Office. The driver of the minivan has been identified as 22-year old Rodrigo Cruz. He fled the scene but was later apprehended by police. “There’s no reason behind, that I can tell you, as to why it occurred, other than complete stupidity,” Spencer said, calling it a “senseless act.” Cruz, the driver, has been arrested for “Open Murder, Duty to Stop at the Scene of an Accident, and for Violating the Conditions of his Parole,” according the police press release .",Two young men in a minivan purposefully swerved towards the mid-50’s female cyclist—the passenger hanging out of the window to hit her.

The Labour leader is understood to have been driving in the Kentish Town area of north London when the incident happened around midday on Sunday.
A spokesman for Sir Keir said he stayed at the scene until an ambulance arrived and reported the incident at a police station later that day.
The Met Police said the driver was not arrested nor interviewed under caution.
They added that the male cyclist suffered a minor injury to his arm and was taken to hospital by ambulance ""as a precaution"".
Sir Keir, a former director of public prosecutions, is not believed to have been injured.
A spokesman for the Labour leader said: ""Keir was involved in a minor road traffic accident on Sunday.
""He spoke to a British Transport Police officer who attended the scene and swapped details with the officer and the other individual involved.""
""Since the incident, Keir has also been in touch with the other individual involved,"" he added.
The Met Police said it was alerted by the London Ambulance Service at about 12:20 GMT to a report of a collision between a cyclist and a car in Grafton Road.
""The driver of the car had stopped at the scene and exchanged details with the cyclist but had left before officers arrived,"" the force said in a statement.

Lee Burford, 44, had ignored medical advice and continued to drive his Renault Clio before the tragic incident in Eastcote Road, Ruislip, west London, on October 25 2020.

Twenty-two month old Zhaoxi Wang, known as Xi Xi, died in the crash and her father Qi Wang was injured.

On Thursday, Burford, from Harrow, pleaded guilty to causing her death by dangerous driving and was jailed for four years and two months.

He was handed concurrent sentences for causing injury by dangerous driving and fraudulently failing to declare he suffered from fits to gain employment as a driver in 2017.

The defendant was also disqualified from driving for seven years and one month.

Opening the facts, Catherine Pattison told the Old Bailey: “The tragic nature of the case is perhaps even more significant because had he notified the DVLA of a seizure he suffered four months earlier on June 22 2020, then Mr Burford would not have had a driving licence at all.”

The prosecutor said the defendant had disregarded advice of medics not only about his epilepsy but also non-prescription drugs and had continued to drive regardless.

She said: “It would appear he consumed a quantity of cocaine some time before getting behind the wheel of October 25 2020, the date of the fatal collision.”

The crash happened at about 4.20pm on a stretch of road with a 30mph speed limit.

Mr Wang was pushing his daughter in a pushchair accompanied by his wife on their way home from a park.

Ms Pattison said: “At the time of the collision Zhaoxi was strapped into her pushchair. She was facing forward.”

Burford’s Clio mounted the pavement and struck Mr Wang and the pushchair.

“Mr Wang was thrown sideways towards a low wall and the pushchair was thrown into the air and landed onto the road.”

The vehicle continued on the pavement, hit a telephone exchange box and sign post before coming to a stop in the road, the court heard.

Mr Wang suffered a broken arm and his young daughter’s injuries were too serious and she died at the scene, the court was told.

In a victim impact statement Mr Wang said losing their daughter had been “absolutely devastating for us” and he was left feeling angry and helpless.

He said: “What I would like to say to the defendant is; you should have stayed away from driving.

“You will never know how it feels to be in this situation. To be in our shoes.

“We were trying to be responsible, good citizens, abiding by the law but of course we had no control over other people. You did the opposite.”","Lee Burford, 44, had ignored medical advice and continued to drive his Renault Clio before the incident in October 2020.",11746,GB,True,1.0,The headline references the 'epileptic driver' (Lee Burford) and the 'toddler' (Zhaoxi Wang).

Police and paramedics were called to Holloway Road, near the junction of Tufnell Park Road, at about 4.50pm on Monday.

The victim, a pedestrian thought to be in her thirties, was pronounced dead at the scene.

The male motorcyclist was taken to hospital. His injuries are not believed to be life threatening.

Mobile phone footage seen by the Standard shows members of the public desperately administering CPR to someone lying prone on the ground, as another group attend to a person sprawled near a crashed motorbike a few feet away.

Florin Casian Danila, 25, was working from his flat in Holloway Road when he began to hear “loud, guttural repetitive screams in a male voice” from outside his window.

The IT consultant told the Standard: “I went at the window and saw the crash scene, the man screaming horribly was the motorcyclist.

“It was quite disturbing…At first we thought the second person might have been a cyclist.

“There were lots of people attending to the guy and the woman. They were giving her CPR…someone was trying to give her mouth to mouth.

“It felt like everyone was coming together to try and save these people.”

In pictures posted on social media a blue forensic tent could be seen behind the police cordon.

Road closures are in place and police in Islington have urged members of the public to avoid the area.

Video captures the moment John Wilson, 73, slams his head on the floor after being bowled over by the cyclist in Tarring Road, Worthing, last Monday morning.

Passersby rushed to the pensioner’s aid after the collision.

The cyclist, a Brighton-based member of Sussex Police, fell from his bike.

Mr Wilson, who is battling prostate cancer, said he was “lucky to be alive”.

The Argus: 

He wants the cyclist to apologise.

He said: “I stepped out on to the wide pavement and didn’t see the bike.

“I was whacked straight in the face, I hit the ground.

“I’m very annoyed at watching the video as I’m a human being with a terminal illness and I think he thought of me like a piece of dirt.

“It’s his attitude. I hit the floor and he did not ring an ambulance – a neighbour had to ring an ambulance.”

Mr Wilson said that as he lay on the floor waiting for emergency services to take him to hospital, passersby demanded the cyclist’s name.

He said the man would not give his full name “as he worked for Sussex Police”.

The pensioner was taken to hospital with facial injuries and his iPhone was beyond repair.

Sussex Police have confirmed the cyclist works for the force.

A spokeswoman said: “The cyclist, who is a member of staff based in Brighton and was off duty, says he gave his name at the time.

“The incident has been referred to the Professional Standards Department to investigate any road traffic offences committed and whether there is a need for disciplinary procedures.”

The Argus: 

Cyclists must not travel on pavements. Any cyclist prosecuted for breaking this rule would be held to be in breach of section 72 of the Highways Act 1835. It punishable by a fine from £30 up to £500.

It may also leave the cyclist open to prosecution for careless riding or dangerous riding.

Dangerous cycling is an offence under section 28 of the Road Traffic Act and is a more serious offence than careless and inconsiderate cycling.

The maximum penalty for dangerous cycling is £2,500.

While not in itself a law, the rule is also enshrined in the Highway Code.

Josh Powell’s 29-year-old wife, Zoe, their daughters Phoebe, eight, and Amelia, four, and six-year-old son Simeon all died in a collision between their people carrier and a lorry.

Powell, 30, and their 18-month-year-old daughter, Penny, survived the crash on the A40 near Oxford and continue to recover.

In a statement issued through Thames Valley police, Powell said the future was uncertain and there were many battles to come. But he said he had wonderful memories of his wife and three children.

“Before the adventure of starting a family nobody truly knows what to expect,” he said. “All of life’s preconceptions and what we see in the world around us meant that life as a family man was so much better than I expected it to be.

“I had been blessed with four wonderful children, whose thirst for life and hunger of adventure kept me busy but in the best possible way.

“As I look to an uncertain future, I reflect on the fun that we had as a family, with feelings of sadness that it was cut so short.

“Phoebe was my first daughter, and was the model of her mother but with a thirst to always know more. Regularly we would adventure and explore the world together. She was clever and able to make great jumps of imagination – her great creations in Lego are testament to this.

“Simeon was just like his father, with a mischievous sense of humour and desire to know more of the world. A keen sportsman, he had been due to play in first football match this week.

“He shared the kind heart of his sisters and wouldn’t be happier than when he knew that everyone was OK. Amelia was kind and spirited. Her tenderness and thoughtfulness much more advanced than her years.

“Her ability to dance and express herself was a true blessing, with an abundance of self-confidence. Tied down by no element of practicality she had the most vivid dreams and imagination.”

Ms Powell ran two companies and blogged about motherhood while Mr Powell is a railway contractor.

He continued: “Myself and Zoe were as different as we were alike. Despite the frequent tensions this would bring, it was of immense benefit having such differing worldviews.

“Our children benefited from this in having adventures but also the quiet to talk. Zoe was a dreamer. More than anything, we made a great partnership to raise a family.

“I want to thank everyone who has rushed to put their arms around to us to support me and Penny. There are many battles to come, and I thank everyone who has stood by me and Penny thus far.”

Police said they received multiple calls from members of the public at 9.50pm on Monday 12 October after the crash involving the family’s Subaru people carrier.

The HGV driver, a 56-year-old man, suffered minor injuries and has cooperated fully with their investigation, Thames Valley police have said.

Zoe Powell, 29, and Phoebe, eight, Simeon, six, and Amelia, four, were killed in the crash on the A40 near Oxford at about 9.50pm on 12 October last year.

Her husband, Josh Powell, and their youngest child, Penny, aged 18 months, were also passengers in the family’s Subaru people carrier and survived the collision.

Oxford coroner’s court heard the couple had collected their four children, who had been staying with Mr Powell’s parents in Worcestershire, and were returning to their home in Chinnor, Oxfordshire.

Mrs Powell was driving the family car, which had a specialist car seat system attached to allow the four children to sit beside each other on the back seat.

The inquest heard how the crash happened when the Subaru swerved into the path of a fully-laden Renault 480 lorry on the opposite side of the road.

Senior coroner Darren Salter said he could not rule out the possibility this was a deliberate act but he did not consider it likely.

“It’s more likely to be due to fatigue or distraction, or a combination of the two, and that the steering input was driver error,” Salter said.

“The cruise control was engaged and at the last moment the accelerator was pressed instead of the brake, which is a phenomenon sometimes seen in these circumstances.”

He reached a conclusion of road traffic collision for Zoe Powell and the three children, and said their deaths occurred when their car “crashed on to the wrong side of the road and collided with an oncoming lorry”.

Mrs Powell, an artist and author, and Phoebe were pronounced dead at the scene, with the cause of their deaths given as multiple injuries.

Simeon and Amelia were taken to the John Radcliffe hospital in Oxford, where they later died. Simeon’s cause of death was recorded as traumatic brain injuries while Amelia suffered a severe head injury.

In a statement read to the inquest, Mr Powell, a railway engineer, said he had no memory of the crash.

Adao Patricio, who was driving the lorry, described seeing the Subaru approaching on the opposite side of the road before suddenly changing direction and swerving into the lane he was driving on.

“I had nowhere to go. The car came across on to my side of the road very quickly – I don’t know how that could even happen,” Patricio said.

“It was travelling fast but I would not say it was travelling at excess speed. I didn’t have time to brake before the car hit my lorry.”

The inquest heard Penny was thrown out of the car by the impact of the collision and was found crying on the ground by drivers who had stopped after the crash.

In a report, investigating officer PC Lyndsey Blackaby said Penny received first aid at the scene and was later discharged from hospital.

Mr Powell was extracted from the wreckage of the Subaru and spent months in hospital recovering from serious injuries.

An investigation did not find any issues with Patricio’s driving before the collision and there was no clear reason why the Subaru swerved into the path of his lorry, the inquest heard.

The coroner described the incident as tragic and offered his condolences to the families of Zoe Powell and her husband, who attended the hearing.

In a statement issued through Thames Valley police, the families said there was much they would “never fully understand about the crash”.

“The possibility that such a small distraction may have caused such a horrific accident should act as a painful reminder for everyone that roads are dangerous places; the actions of a single moment have wrecked an entire family and had a lasting impact on everyone around them,” they said.

The families described how Mrs Powell, Phoebe, Simeon and Amelia “carried themselves excited by the joy of life”.

“In doing so they have left us with an abundance of happy memories that we can reflect back on fondly,” they said.","Coroner says ‘fatigue or distraction’ may be cause, while families state they will ‘never fully understand’",5763,GB,True,1.0,The headline references all key parties involved in the crash: 'Mother and children' and 'lorry'.,1.0,The headline refers to all involved parties as humans ('Mother and children') and not as objects or vehicles.,1.0,The headline uses active voice to describe the crash ('swerved into lorry').,"Driver Zoe Powell swerved her car into lorry driver Adao Patricio's path, killing herself and three of her children","Added the names of the drivers, Zoe Powell and Adao Patricio, to clearly identify all parties involved.",Replaced 'car' and 'lorry' with 'driver' to emphasize the human element.,Used active voice to clearly show that Zoe Powell swerved her car into Adao Patricio's path.,True,5763,"[{'id': 13551, 'groupid': None, 'transportationmode': 5, 'health': 3, 'child': 0, 'underinfluence': 0, 'hitrun': 0}, {'id': 13552, 'groupid': None, 'transportationmode': 5, 'health': 3, 'child': 1, 'underinfluence': 0, 'hitrun': 0}, {'id': 13553, 'groupid': None, 'transportationmode': 5, 'health': 3, 'child': 1, 'underinfluence': 0, 'hitrun': 0}, {'id': 13554, 'groupid': None, 'transportationmode': 5, 'health': 3, 'child': 1, 'underinfluence': 0, 'hitrun': 0}, {'id': 13555, 'groupid': None, 'transportationmode': 5, 'health': 2, 'child': 0, 'underinfluence': 0, 'hitrun': 0}, {'id': 13556, 'groupid': None, 'transportationmode': 5, 'health': 2, 'child': 1, 'underinfluence': 0, 'hitrun': 0}]",0,0,2,4

Witnesses described scenes of “utter chaos” as a 19-year-old female driver lost control of an Audi A3 turning a corner in West Kensington at “high speed” last night.

One man in his twenties suffered a suspected broken neck when he was thrown into the air after being hit head-on and was in a critical condition today.

Three other men — one aged 56 and two in their twenties — were also taken to hospital after emergency treatment at the scene.

Witnesses said the driver had been celebrating her birthday before the collision as she turned from North End Road into Mund Street at about 6.45pm.

An 18-year-old onlooker, who claimed to be a former schoolmate of the driver, said: “She was driving from McDonald’s celebrating her birthday and came round the bend at about 60mph.

“She swung on to the pavement and into one guy, who slammed into the windscreen. He flew up in the air and landed on his head.

“The driver then skidded into another man. Two more people were smashed into railings.

“There’s so much blood everywhere — it’s the worst thing I’ve ever seen.”

One witness described the scene as a “battlefield” as members of the public, including three medical students, helped paramedics tending to the wounded on stretchers scattered across the street.

A 20-year-old shopkeeper whose business overlooks the junction said: “It looked like the end of a battle in a film, with bodies on stretchers, children crying and doctors racing around trying to save people.”

IT worker Srivinas Namilikonda, 32, who had been passing by, said: “It was a horrific feeling. I have never seen anything like this before. So many people were crying.”

The driver was arrested and remains in police custody. A passenger in the Audi was treated for minor injuries.

The Met Police said: “A 56-year-old man and two men in their twenties are in a non-life-threatening condition. A fourth man, in his twenties, remains in a critical condition.

Lehigh Valley Hospital Spokesperson Matthew Burns said Naysa Felix, 7, who was flown to Lehigh Valley Hospital from the scene of the crash Tuesday, remained in critical condition as of Wednesday morning.

Reading Hospital and Medical Center spokesperson Joe Lyons said the girl’s father, John Felix, was ‘still in observation,’ and one of her two brothers, Carlton Felix, 4, was in good condition at Reading Hospital and Medical Center, where they were transported by ambulance after the crash.

The third child injured in the crash, William Felix, was reported to initially have been transported to Reading Hospital and Medical Center by ambulance after the crash, however, Lyons said it was likely the boy had been transferred to the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.

Initial reports indicated the crash was at High Street at Grosstown Road, and while sources indicate traffic is tied up at that intersection, the crash actually occurred at Old Reading Pike and Grosstown Road.

The call for the crash came in around 4 p.m. Initial reports indicated an ‘unrestrained’ child may have been ejected from one of the vehicles.

Harry Farley, 21, was killed when his Ford Fiesta left the road and hit the tree off the B2100 Rotherfield Road in Crowborough.

He has today been named by police following the fatal collision on the evening of Saturday, September 26.

In a statement, his family said: “Harry was hardworking, beautiful and kind.

“He was passionately loyal and cared unconditionally for his friends and family.

“He would instinctively protect and come to the aid of anyone or anything in need of help, regardless.

“But most of all he was modest, someone with so many talents that he shared with so few, always choosing to encourage and celebrate others in their own achievements.

“The tributes and memories shared by so many of his wonderful friends are overwhelming and a testimony of the impact he had on those around him.

“Harry was our son, a brother to Charlie and Alfie and a friend to so many. We will always be so very proud of who he was and will miss him always. The space he leaves behind is immeasurable.”

Harry, from Broad Oak in Heathfield, died at the scene of the crash.

A 21-year-old man who was also travelling in the car suffered a leg injury, and a third passenger, a 20-year-old man, suffered minor injuries.

A Sussex Police spokesman said: “Officers are continuing an investigation into the collision and anyone with information is asked to come forward.

Joshua Fletcher, who was 16 years old , died after a collision with a car on the Southern Distributor Road (SDR) in October.

Now, his family has started a petition calling for changes to be made to the stretch of the road where he died.

""A young boy had so much life left but tragically taken,"" said Avril Fletcher, Joshua's aunt, who started the petition.

""The family are devastated. I want the council to rethink the road as this is not the first time this has happened. Something needs doing.""

Joshua Fletcher died on October 16, after colliding with a Ford Focus outside of the Blaina Wharf pub.

The driver of the Focus, a 28-year-old man from Rhondda Cynon Taf, was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and has since been released under investigation.

Following the incident, calls were made for local leaders, including councillors, the chief constable of Gwent Police, and local politicians, to join together and review accident statistics for the SDR to decide whether action could be taken to make the road safer.

Further calls to review the road were made following another incident nearby on November 2, in which a second teenage boy came off his bike and needed hospital treatment following a collision with a car.

""The road is so dangerous, you would think that after young Josh dying a few weeks ago people would be more careful,"" said Christine Gulliford, mother of 14-year-old Codi Gulliford who was involved in the latest incident.

Following this incident, a spokesperson for Newport City Council said: ""We have a number of projects to further enhance safe cycling and walking routes across the city as part of our active travel programme and want to develop these further to join up the network.

""The police will conduct a thorough investigation into the recent incidents on the SDR. We and the road operator will support them fully in that process.

""When the investigation and legal processes have concluded, the council will work with the police to establish if any further measures need to be considered.""


Newport council announced its plans to improve the cycling and walking network across the city back in June.

These include an ""active travel project"" on Monkey Island, which is located on the opposite side of the River Usk from the spot where both recent incidents took place.

On November 6, the council also announced that it had signed the 'Healthy Travel Charter', alongside 21 other public sector organisations working across Gwent.

The charter aims to encourage staff to travel in a sustainable way to and from work, including walking, cycling, and the use of public transport.
