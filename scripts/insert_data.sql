Metro Nashville police said officers found the man lying in the middle of the road while out on patrol in West Nashville around midnight. He was rushed to the hospital in critical condition.

The hit-and-run crash investigation found the man was traveling westbound on Charlotte Ave. when he was struck from behind by a Nissan Titan. The bicyclist was not wearing a helmet when the crash happened just west of the 31st Avenue intersection.

James Aitcheson watches cars go up and down Charlotte Ave. while he waits for the bus. He said cars have come extremely close to hitting him multiple times while crossing the road, so he was not surprised to hear about this crash.

“People on this street don’t care,” Aitcheson said. “They speed all the time, which is a big problem. They are in a hurry to get to wherever they are going. They don’t care about pedestrians. I think more stop lights need to be put up on Charlotte, and they need to reduce the speed or at least ticket the people who speed.”

The crash happened one block west of where the dedicated bike lane ends on Charlotte Ave. at 28th Ave. and bikers are forced to share the road with cars that only have a handful of warning signs telling them to give cyclists a full lane.

Leaders with the Transit Alliance of Middle Tennessee said Mayor Freddie O’Connell’s transportation improvement program, set to be voted on as part of the November ballot, would help transform streets to make they safer for cars, pedestrians and bikers.

“That is going to make things safer, it is going to improve the economy and it is going to make it a lot easier to get from neighborhood to neighborhood walking and biking and taking transit,” Walk Bike Nashville representative Wesley Smith said.

Police said this would be the first deadly bike crash so far this year. Nine pedestrians have already been killed.

Detectives are currently working on a total of five open fatal hit-and-run cases, police said.

Aitcheson said people need to be on alert for drivers who are not paying attention to prevent more tragic crashes.

“Every time I am crossing this street it is dangerous,” Aitcheson said. “I’m just always trying to watch for where the cars are. Know how fast I can move when I am moving and try to make eye contact with the people behind the drivers’ wheels so they see that I am at least looking at them.”');

The pickup truck then traveled off the left side of the roadway and crossed over a sidewalk before striking a utility pole and railroad ties in a parking lot. Ford was not wearing a seat belt and struck his head when his vehicle hit the pole.

"The scooter was in pieces. The truck had obviously barreled across and hit the pole across the street," said Tony Block, owner of Bar: Cigar Especial.

Brumley, a 30-year-old father of two, lost his life in a hit-and-run incident on Nolensville Pike, one of the city''s busiest and notoriously dangerous streets.

The incident unfolded when Brumley, an avid runner, was struck and killed by a white Dodge Challenger while jogging along Nolensville Pike and McClain Avenue. The driver never stopped.
 
Patterson, overwhelmed with grief, is not only mourning the untimely loss of her son, but also advocating for justice in his case. She shares her feelings in the player above, holding back tears.

The police are seeking to question 19-year-old Jefry Francisco Rubi Orellana in connection with the hit-and-run, and the family is urging him to come forward and cooperate with authorities.

Anyone with information on Orellana is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 615-742-7463.

“I know he must be scared. We just want justice,” pleaded Patterson.

The family is also calling for increased safety measures along Nolensville Pike, a a road that sees over 26,000 vehicles daily.

According to the Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT), there have been 816 reported crashes along this corridor since 2014, with 68 involving pedestrians or bicyclists. Tragically, 59 of these incidents resulted in fatalities or serious injuries, with 40% involving pedestrians or individuals using wheelchairs.

To address the concerning safety record, the family is hopeful that something positive can emerge from the tragedy.

With $13 million in federal grant funding allocated for improvements, Nolensville Pike is set to undergo significant upgrades from McCall Street to Haywood Lane.

These will include, but are not limited to the following:

    building safe sidewalk connections where they are currently missing
    and/or are in need of repair
    constructing additional street lighting and pedestrian-scale lighting to improve visibility during dark and low-light conditions;
    constructing safer intersections and crossings, including adding high visibility crosswalks, adding pedestrian hybrid beacons at strategic locations, adjusting signal timings to include leading pedestrian intervals, and constructing bulb-out intersection features
    enhancing bus stop designs to ensure safe access

Patterson expressed her hope that these improvements would prevent future tragedies.
“If this helps get the roads fixed or the lighting or whatever it is that they need and saves one person''s life, I would be grateful and very happy,” she said.

Five vehicles were involved in the crash, including a Pioneer Trails charter bus that was transporting students from the Tuscarawas Valley local school district in eastern Ohio, said Sean Grady, Licking county emergency management agency director. There were a total of 57 people onboard, he said.

Lt Nathan Dennis of the Ohio State Highway Patrol confirmed that people were killed in the crash and said “18 people were taken from the bus (overall),” including 15 children, but he declined to specify how many deaths had occurred and declined further comment since authorities were still notifying the victims’ families.

The bus was carrying Tuscarawas Valley students and chaperones to an Ohio School Boards Association conference in Columbus, said Derek Varansky, the superintendent.

“Right now, our focus is on getting in touch with our Tusky Valley families who had loved ones on the bus and providing support to our entire school community,” Varansky said in a Facebook post.

The conference was canceled after organizers learned of the crash.

“Given this devastating news, we have canceled our conference. Right now, our focus is on providing support to Tuscarawas Valley. That includes making grief counselors from our trade show available,” said Jeff Chambers, the association’s director of communication services.

The accident occurred shortly before 9am on Interstate 70 West in Licking county, near the Smoke Road underpass and about 26 miles (42km) east of Columbus. The cause was not immediately known.

The injured were being treated at seven hospitals.

In a statement, Pioneer Trails, the charter bus company, confirmed there was an incident involving one of its buses Tuesday morning.

“Pioneer is fully cooperating with the authorities as we work to find the cause of the accident,” the company’s statement said. “Our thoughts and prayers go out to all of those impacted by this accident. As this is an ongoing investigation, there will be no further comments.”

The American Red Cross of Central and Southern Ohio said it fulfilled a request for more blood from one hospital in the area, sending 30 units to a hospital in the Mount Carmel Health System, said Marita Salkowski, regional communications director. A center was set up at a United Methodist Church in Etna for bus passengers not in need of medical attention to go to and contact loved ones, she said.

Numerous emergency responders were at the scene, and Ohio Department of Transportation cameras from the area showed smoke coming from the crash site. Police officers were blocking the entrance ramps to I-70 East and West near the scene of the accident, increasing traffic along the road leading to the interstate. Dozens of emergency response vehicles were still at the scene of the accident several hours after it occurred.

Mickey Lymon, an investigator with the Licking county coroner’s office, said they had been called to the scene, but deferred other questions to the state police.

Five people – including two children – who were killed after a car crashed into the beer garden of a pub in Daylesford in rural Victoria were members of two “family groups” who were visiting the area, police say.

Just after 6pm on Sunday, a white BMW SUV mounted the kerb and hit patrons on the front lawn of the Royal Daylesford hotel, police said.

The Victorian chief police commissioner, Shane Patton, on Monday said four victims died at the scene. The victims include two men, believed to be aged in their 30s, a woman believed to be aged in her 40s, and a boy.

A female child, reportedly a teenager, was flown to the Alfred hospital in Melbourne where she later died on Sunday evening.

“There were, in essence, two … different family groups that were known to each other who were significantly involved and impacted by this,” Patton said.

The victims are yet to be formally identified.

Five people were taken to hospital with a range of injuries, including a boy, believed to be aged 6, who is in a stable condition at the Royal Children’s hospital. Police said a 35-year-old woman is in a serious condition in the intensive care unit at the Royal Melbourne hospital.

A 43-year-old woman and a 38-year-old man, flown to Royal Melbourne hospital, are understood to be stable, Patton said. An 11-month-old baby was flown to Ballarat Base hospital and is also in a stable condition.

Patton said the families were “visitors just going about their everyday life, just enjoying themselves on a beautiful Sunday afternoon”.

“It is an absolute tragedy,” he said.

The driver of the BMW, a 66-year-old man from Mount Macedon, was taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.

The driver was breath tested and did not have alcohol in his system, Patton said. The driver’s blood tests will also be analysed.

Police from the major collision investigation unit are expected to interview the man on Monday afternoon.

Patton said it was too early to determine if speed was a factor in the fatal crash.

He paid tribute to the first responders on the scene, saying they would carry the scene with them for “many years”.

“It may haunt them forever,” he said.

“It’s one of the most confronting scenes, I’ve been told, that experienced officers have been to.”

The Victoria Ambulance’s regional director, Trevor Weston, told Nine’s Today show emergency crews had been confronted with “an extremely chaotic scene”.

He said members of the public had done a “fantastic job” to help the injured until ambulance paramedics arrived. “We had about seven ambulances and four ambulance helicopters dispatched and conveyed those patients off to hospital,” Weston said.

He told reporters that the injuries were “quite traumatic for a number of those patients”.

Daylesford was a close-knit community, he said, and some of the initial crews were from the area. “You never want to respond to any incident like this but certainly not in your home town,” Weston said.

The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, thanked those who helped victims – including emergency services workers – at the scene of the “horrific” crash.

“My thoughts are with all those injured, and with the friends and family of those who have tragically died,” Allan said on X, formerly known as Twitter, on Monday morning.

The Hepburn shire mayor, Brian Hood, said Daylesford would have been crowded on Sunday, with many people enjoying the warm evening over the unofficial Melbourne Cup long weekend. “This will send shock waves through the community for some time,” he told ABC TV.

The federal infrastructure minister, Catherine King, whose Ballarat electorate includes Daylesford, asked the community to follow advice from emergency services as crews carry out their work.

Five people, including two children, were killed.

They included a 38-year-old man and his 11-year-old son, and a 44-year-old woman and her 30-year-old male partner, along with the woman''s nine-year-old daughter.

At the scene on Monday morning, full jugs, stacks of cups and sunglasses remained untouched on picnic tables where diners had been enjoying the day.

A dog bowl lay on one section of a damaged bench and a shoe could be seen lying on the grass behind police tape as investigators in hazmat suits combed through debris.

Police say the driver, a 66-year-old Macedon man, returned a zero blood-alcohol reading and is expected to be interviewed on Tuesday.

Local businessman Mark Ward was in tears as he sat and watched residents lay tributes at the scene.

"Our community is enormously tight-knit — we are so proud of our town," Mr Ward said.

"For this to happen in such a drastic way, it''s devastating for everyone."

Mr Ward said he had offered his staff the day off to take time to process and grieve.

"A lot of our locals are struggling to cope," he said.

"In fact, I''m struggling to cope."

Known for its mineral springs, spas and regional cuisine, the town swells with tourists during holiday periods.

Assistant Commissioner for Road Policing Glenn Weir told the ABC that all of those who died were tourists who had travelled to Daylesford from Melbourne.

"It should have been, and it was, a great day, the weather was perfect," he said.

"It should have been a great day and it''s ended in absolute tragedy for those who have obviously lost their lives, their family, the injured, but broadly the community of Daylesford, which is one of the great tourism and lifestyle destinations in Victoria.

"It''s just absolutely heartbreaking."

Established in 1916, the Royal Daylesford Hotel is one of the town''s oldest and most popular pubs.

It is situated next to a busy roundabout at the intersection of the town''s main streets.

Victoria Police Chief commissioner Shane Patton said the coroner might look into the safety of the grassy outdoor dining area used by the hotel as part of the investigation into the incident.

"It''s right in the middle of town," Hepburn Shire Mayor Brian Hood said.

"That in itself amplifies the impact.

"Everyone knows the pub, they know the outdoor dining area." 

Longtime local Joanna Parker said she was on her way to get groceries when she saw the shocking scene on Sunday night.

"There were lots of locals that were crying," she said.

"All the girls from the shops that work at the restaurants said, ''We will have to close.''

Chief Commissioner Patton said people raced to help.

"There were numerous people there who selflessly came out and aided those who were dying, who needed first aid," he said.

Rob Green and Michelle Gray were visiting Daylesford for the weekend and considered stopping at the hotel for a drink, but decided against it.

"We saw them sitting out the front at about 3pm … about 60 people," Mr Green said.

"We thought, ''Oh it would be a nice place to stop for a beer.

"It''s horrible — it must be awful for the local community."

Hepburn Shire Deputy Mayor Lesley Hewitt, who lives near the hotel, said there had been a huge outpouring of support.

"My phone has been ringing off the hook, but not just from locals — from people all over the country checking what''s going on," she said.

"It is a tough time and people will need support, and people will need the opportunity to come together and reflect on this, on the loss, on how this could happen."

''Destroyed in an instant''
Local musician Anthony Rodgers said he had planned to play outside the pub on Sunday night.

"I hadn''t been out because of the COVID thing … and I thought I''ll come out and have a sing and I was going to set up near the statue on the grass, sing a few songs, and I got to cutting the grass way late and I didn''t come up," he said.

"But if I had I would have been standing there, and it''s just shocked me."

Mary Chase had travelled to Daylesford for a wedding and was in the hotel with friends waiting to have dinner when the crash occurred.

"We were all taken to the back of the pub and evacuated, and we were taken out, and we already saw white sheets," she said.

"So they were already covering up people."

Ms Chase said it took a few minutes for the gravity of the situation to register.

"More and more police were coming, and then helicopters and then yeah — we started to realise how bad it was," she said.

"We literally walked through that beer garden five minutes before."

Melbourne residents Jenna Acquarola and James Deriu said they were sitting at the crash site an hour before the incident.

"It was a beautiful night," Ms Acquarola said.

"The sun was going down, everyone was enjoying the sun, and it was destroyed in an instant.

Emergency services were called to the scene on Maxwells Avenue, Ashcroft, about 10:50am on Monday, where a grey Ford sedan crashed into a tree and a power pole.

The vehicle split in two and came to rest in the front yard of a house.

The two boys, who were rear passengers in the car, died at the scene. They are yet to be formally identified.

It is alleged the driver and the front-seat passenger — believed to be "young males" — fled the crash scene.

CCTV footage obtained by the ABC shows the moment of the crash before one person emerged from the driver''s seat of the vehicle wreckage.

The person appears to walk across the front lawn to briefly inspect the scene before fleeing.

Police Assistant Commissioner Brett McFadden, from the state''s traffic and highway patrol, said the bystanders witnessed "absolute destruction" and "carnage".

"Anyone that would have witnessed that crash would no doubt be traumatised by it," he said.

Police believe the car was travelling north on Maxwells Avenue "well above" the 50 kilometre per hour speed limit.

Police also want to speak to the rider of a trail bike which was seen travelling on the street at the same time as the crash.

CCTV footage from the scene shows the bike riding on to the grass moments after the crash.

Assistant Commissioner McFadden said it was unclear what, if any, role the bike may have played in the incident but that it was an "active line of investigation".

Search for those who fled scene
Police dogs have been used to scour the bushland near Cabramatta Creek at Magee Street and Maxwells Avenue in the search for those who left the scene.

The assistant commissioner said inquiries into how the crash occurred and the state of the remaining occupants of the car are ongoing.

"They just need to present themselves to a police station so we can engage with them and they can assist us with the inquiries and work out how this tragic situation unfolded," he said.

"The driver is ultimately responsible for themselves, the passengers and the others on the road."

A crime scene was established and the road cordoned off.

The scene will be forensically examined by the crash investigation unit.

Assistant commissioner McFadden said speeding was a "selfish" act that had played a large role in more than 100 deaths this year.

"The community should be outraged and the wider community should take stock that this is a result of speeding," he said.

"She kept saying, ''This is exactly what Josh would have wanted,''" Ms Austin said.

"He''s spreading love everywhere and saving lives, and that''s what he was about."

''Hold your kids tight''
An online fundraiser set up for funeral costs has attracted almost $50,000 in donations.

Friends have set up a small memorial at the crash site, near Josh''s home, and at Ambarvale High School, where Josh was in year 7.

Ms Austin said the family''s main message was to parents and siblings.

"Hold your kids tight, tell your kids you love them every day, siblings tell each other you love them every day," she said.

"Don''t take life for granted."

The family has shared several photos of Josh, but Ms Austin said they were "horrified" by the publication of footage and images of the moment he was hit by the truck.

"It''s extremely disrespectful," she said.

"It''s hard, because the family has seen it — you can imagine?"

Push for safe crossing
Joshua''s death has sparked calls for safety improvements on the single-lane Appin Road, a single-lane road that runs through villages south of Sydney and is frequently used by heavy freight.

Ms Austin said Appin lacked safe road crossings.

"Where the accident happened there''s nothing — literally nothing," she said.

"There''s no pedestrian crossing, no slow-down, the limit is 50 kilometres an hour."

Mr Warren said he would advocate for "a safety review of both vehicular and pedestrian movement in and around Appin".

"Ultimately what we need is a pedestrian crossing and that is going to be a focus for me," he said.');

The Metro Nashville Police Department said the crash happened at approximately 6:45 p.m. on Highway 100 near Harpeth Trace Drive on Friday, Sept. 8. 

A preliminary investigation shows that 23-year-old Alyssa Milligan of Mt. Juliet, was riding with another cyclist on Highway 100 when she was struck by a Ford F-150 pickup truck. 

Authorities reported Milligan was hit by the passenger side of the pickup truck and thrown off her bike. She was taken to Vanderbilt University Medical Center, where she was pronounced dead. 

According to police, the 46-year-old driver of the pickup truck told officers that he saw a cyclist ahead of him on the right side of the roadway. He claimed that as he was attempting to change lanes, he looked over his shoulder, and the cyclist was suddenly in front of him.  

Officials said it appears that the pickup truck failed to yield to the right of way to Milligan. The pickup truck driver reportedly showed no signs of impairment at the scene. 

Authorities said charges are possible pending the conclusion of the investigation into the deadly collision, which remains ongoing.

Three cars, a black Mercedes SUV, a Toyota Echo and a Toyota Rav4, were involved in the incident that occurred on Sadleir Avenue in Heckenberg, near Liverpool, just before 9.30pm.

Police believe "high speed" was a contributing factor and are investigating a person of interest after the occupants of the Mercedes allegedly fled in what''s being described as "abhorrent behaviour".

Paramedics treated 24-year-old Alina Kauffman and her 15-year-old brother, Ernesto Salazer, at the scene but they weren''t able to be revived.

The pair were driving home after the sister picked up her brother from his new job and were just metres away from their house when their car was struck.

About 2pm on Saturday, a 20-year-old man was arrested after he went to Liverpool Police Station. 

The man, who was driving with a disqualified licence, has been charged and will appear before Parramatta Bail Court on Sunday.

He was charged with a number of offences including two counts of dangerous driving occasioning death.

Angelina Kauffman, the mother of two siblings, spoke to media on Saturday about her devastating loss.

"My daughter she''s such a beautiful girl, she loves her brother," Ms Kauffman said.

"And my son he loves his sister. Now my son is gone and my daughter she''s gone. My kids are gone and I have to live the rest of my life with no kids, why? I don''t understand."

According to police, the Mercedes collided head-on with the Toyota Echo occupied by the siblings, before slamming into a stationary Toyota and flipping on its side.

They allege three occupants managed to get out of the rolled car and escaped in another vehicle, a Volkswagen Golf.

"The evidence at this stage suggest the Mercedes crossed to the incorrect side of the road attempting to overtake a car in front of it and has collided head-on with the Toyota Echo," Acting Assistant Commissioner Anthony Boyd said.

"I think it''s abhorrent behaviour. I think the nature of the collision itself is totally unacceptable behaviour.

"And then to flee the scene and not offer assistance to the people in a vehicle, you may have been able to provide some form of first aid which may have assisted in saving their lives."

He said the car had been reported as stolen but its status was under investigation.

Police are also trying to confirm the relationship between the VW Golf and the Mercedes.

Late on Friday, the VW''s 18-year-old driver attended Liverpool Police Station where he was arrested. He has since being released without being charged.

Neighbours, including Parisa Mesri, rushed to the scene to offer assistance after hearing a "loud sound".

"I came out and see that two cars had accident together and people that were inside the small car we tried to help them," Ms Mesri said.

"But we couldn''t do anything because it was very bad. Other neighbours tried to help the boy before the ambulance came."

She said she saw a number of people jump out of a car and assumed they were going to help the victims but "they ran away".

The child died at the scene after being hit by a car whilst out cycling
West Midlands Ambulance Service said a pedestrian who had also been hit by a car near the scene was taken to the Heartlands Hospital with minor injuries.

The death is the third involving a cyclist in Birmingham in as many weeks and the area''s cycling commissioner has called for urgent safety improvements.

Mohammed, who is from the area, told BBC News a pedestrian was struck by a vehicle as he ran to help the 12-year-old and was taken away in an ambulance. He said people did not feel safe on the streets.

"He was trying to show his support and go help him," he said.

"As a result of that he has been injured as well."

He said there had been a few recent incidents with vehicles and pedestrians on the road.

A pedestrian narrowly avoided being struck by a car that went on to into a fence on the same stretch on Tuesday.

"He lost control of the car and hit the fence," Mohammed said.

"It just shows as a community, me, myself as a 16-year-old you don''t feel safe walking around these streets any more.."

West Midlands Cycling Commissioner Adam Tranter, who was appointed in 2021, has called for tougher policing and extra road safety measures from Birmingham City Council after a spate of fatal crashes involving bikes.

''Grim statistics''
Speaking before the latest death, he said collisions happened "with such a regularity that you could be fooled into thinking that this is normal".

"My message is that this is not normal," Mr Tranter said.

The Better Streets for Birmingham group also called for improved safety in a letter published on Twitter on Friday.

It tweeted: "The killing of a child cyclist now puts the grim statistics in our letter out of date. The situation is untenable."

In its letter, the group criticised what it described as a "delay" in delivering road safety measures.

It has also invited people to a vigil on Saturday, at the junction of Belgrave Middleway and Horton Square, where a cyclist died on 16 May.
