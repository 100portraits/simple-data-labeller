Metro Nashville police said officers found the man lying in the middle of the road while out on patrol in West Nashville around midnight. He was rushed to the hospital in critical condition.

The hit-and-run crash investigation found the man was traveling westbound on Charlotte Ave. when he was struck from behind by a Nissan Titan. The bicyclist was not wearing a helmet when the crash happened just west of the 31st Avenue intersection.

James Aitcheson watches cars go up and down Charlotte Ave. while he waits for the bus. He said cars have come extremely close to hitting him multiple times while crossing the road, so he was not surprised to hear about this crash.

“People on this street don’t care,” Aitcheson said. “They speed all the time, which is a big problem. They are in a hurry to get to wherever they are going. They don’t care about pedestrians. I think more stop lights need to be put up on Charlotte, and they need to reduce the speed or at least ticket the people who speed.”

The crash happened one block west of where the dedicated bike lane ends on Charlotte Ave. at 28th Ave. and bikers are forced to share the road with cars that only have a handful of warning signs telling them to give cyclists a full lane.

Leaders with the Transit Alliance of Middle Tennessee said Mayor Freddie O’Connell’s transportation improvement program, set to be voted on as part of the November ballot, would help transform streets to make they safer for cars, pedestrians and bikers.

“That is going to make things safer, it is going to improve the economy and it is going to make it a lot easier to get from neighborhood to neighborhood walking and biking and taking transit,” Walk Bike Nashville representative Wesley Smith said.

Police said this would be the first deadly bike crash so far this year. Nine pedestrians have already been killed.

Detectives are currently working on a total of five open fatal hit-and-run cases, police said.

Aitcheson said people need to be on alert for drivers who are not paying attention to prevent more tragic crashes.

“Every time I am crossing this street it is dangerous,” Aitcheson said. “I’m just always trying to watch for where the cars are. Know how fast I can move when I am moving and try to make eye contact with the people behind the drivers’ wheels so they see that I am at least looking at them.”');

The pickup truck then traveled off the left side of the roadway and crossed over a sidewalk before striking a utility pole and railroad ties in a parking lot. Ford was not wearing a seat belt and struck his head when his vehicle hit the pole.

"The scooter was in pieces. The truck had obviously barreled across and hit the pole across the street," said Tony Block, owner of Bar: Cigar Especial.

Brumley, a 30-year-old father of two, lost his life in a hit-and-run incident on Nolensville Pike, one of the city''s busiest and notoriously dangerous streets.

The incident unfolded when Brumley, an avid runner, was struck and killed by a white Dodge Challenger while jogging along Nolensville Pike and McClain Avenue. The driver never stopped.
 
Patterson, overwhelmed with grief, is not only mourning the untimely loss of her son, but also advocating for justice in his case. She shares her feelings in the player above, holding back tears.

The police are seeking to question 19-year-old Jefry Francisco Rubi Orellana in connection with the hit-and-run, and the family is urging him to come forward and cooperate with authorities.

Anyone with information on Orellana is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 615-742-7463.

“I know he must be scared. We just want justice,” pleaded Patterson.

The family is also calling for increased safety measures along Nolensville Pike, a a road that sees over 26,000 vehicles daily.

According to the Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT), there have been 816 reported crashes along this corridor since 2014, with 68 involving pedestrians or bicyclists. Tragically, 59 of these incidents resulted in fatalities or serious injuries, with 40% involving pedestrians or individuals using wheelchairs.

To address the concerning safety record, the family is hopeful that something positive can emerge from the tragedy.

With $13 million in federal grant funding allocated for improvements, Nolensville Pike is set to undergo significant upgrades from McCall Street to Haywood Lane.

These will include, but are not limited to the following:

    building safe sidewalk connections where they are currently missing
    and/or are in need of repair
    constructing additional street lighting and pedestrian-scale lighting to improve visibility during dark and low-light conditions;
    constructing safer intersections and crossings, including adding high visibility crosswalks, adding pedestrian hybrid beacons at strategic locations, adjusting signal timings to include leading pedestrian intervals, and constructing bulb-out intersection features
    enhancing bus stop designs to ensure safe access

Patterson expressed her hope that these improvements would prevent future tragedies.
“If this helps get the roads fixed or the lighting or whatever it is that they need and saves one person''s life, I would be grateful and very happy,” she said.

Five vehicles were involved in the crash, including a Pioneer Trails charter bus that was transporting students from the Tuscarawas Valley local school district in eastern Ohio, said Sean Grady, Licking county emergency management agency director. There were a total of 57 people onboard, he said.

Lt Nathan Dennis of the Ohio State Highway Patrol confirmed that people were killed in the crash and said “18 people were taken from the bus (overall),” including 15 children, but he declined to specify how many deaths had occurred and declined further comment since authorities were still notifying the victims’ families.

The bus was carrying Tuscarawas Valley students and chaperones to an Ohio School Boards Association conference in Columbus, said Derek Varansky, the superintendent.

“Right now, our focus is on getting in touch with our Tusky Valley families who had loved ones on the bus and providing support to our entire school community,” Varansky said in a Facebook post.

The conference was canceled after organizers learned of the crash.

“Given this devastating news, we have canceled our conference. Right now, our focus is on providing support to Tuscarawas Valley. That includes making grief counselors from our trade show available,” said Jeff Chambers, the association’s director of communication services.

The accident occurred shortly before 9am on Interstate 70 West in Licking county, near the Smoke Road underpass and about 26 miles (42km) east of Columbus. The cause was not immediately known.

The injured were being treated at seven hospitals.

In a statement, Pioneer Trails, the charter bus company, confirmed there was an incident involving one of its buses Tuesday morning.

“Pioneer is fully cooperating with the authorities as we work to find the cause of the accident,” the company’s statement said. “Our thoughts and prayers go out to all of those impacted by this accident. As this is an ongoing investigation, there will be no further comments.”

The American Red Cross of Central and Southern Ohio said it fulfilled a request for more blood from one hospital in the area, sending 30 units to a hospital in the Mount Carmel Health System, said Marita Salkowski, regional communications director. A center was set up at a United Methodist Church in Etna for bus passengers not in need of medical attention to go to and contact loved ones, she said.

Numerous emergency responders were at the scene, and Ohio Department of Transportation cameras from the area showed smoke coming from the crash site. Police officers were blocking the entrance ramps to I-70 East and West near the scene of the accident, increasing traffic along the road leading to the interstate. Dozens of emergency response vehicles were still at the scene of the accident several hours after it occurred.

Mickey Lymon, an investigator with the Licking county coroner’s office, said they had been called to the scene, but deferred other questions to the state police.

Five people – including two children – who were killed after a car crashed into the beer garden of a pub in Daylesford in rural Victoria were members of two “family groups” who were visiting the area, police say.

Just after 6pm on Sunday, a white BMW SUV mounted the kerb and hit patrons on the front lawn of the Royal Daylesford hotel, police said.

The Victorian chief police commissioner, Shane Patton, on Monday said four victims died at the scene. The victims include two men, believed to be aged in their 30s, a woman believed to be aged in her 40s, and a boy.

A female child, reportedly a teenager, was flown to the Alfred hospital in Melbourne where she later died on Sunday evening.

“There were, in essence, two … different family groups that were known to each other who were significantly involved and impacted by this,” Patton said.

The victims are yet to be formally identified.

Five people were taken to hospital with a range of injuries, including a boy, believed to be aged 6, who is in a stable condition at the Royal Children’s hospital. Police said a 35-year-old woman is in a serious condition in the intensive care unit at the Royal Melbourne hospital.

A 43-year-old woman and a 38-year-old man, flown to Royal Melbourne hospital, are understood to be stable, Patton said. An 11-month-old baby was flown to Ballarat Base hospital and is also in a stable condition.

Patton said the families were “visitors just going about their everyday life, just enjoying themselves on a beautiful Sunday afternoon”.

“It is an absolute tragedy,” he said.

The driver of the BMW, a 66-year-old man from Mount Macedon, was taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.

The driver was breath tested and did not have alcohol in his system, Patton said. The driver’s blood tests will also be analysed.

Police from the major collision investigation unit are expected to interview the man on Monday afternoon.

Patton said it was too early to determine if speed was a factor in the fatal crash.

He paid tribute to the first responders on the scene, saying they would carry the scene with them for “many years”.

“It may haunt them forever,” he said.

“It’s one of the most confronting scenes, I’ve been told, that experienced officers have been to.”

The Victoria Ambulance’s regional director, Trevor Weston, told Nine’s Today show emergency crews had been confronted with “an extremely chaotic scene”.

He said members of the public had done a “fantastic job” to help the injured until ambulance paramedics arrived. “We had about seven ambulances and four ambulance helicopters dispatched and conveyed those patients off to hospital,” Weston said.

He told reporters that the injuries were “quite traumatic for a number of those patients”.

Daylesford was a close-knit community, he said, and some of the initial crews were from the area. “You never want to respond to any incident like this but certainly not in your home town,” Weston said.

The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, thanked those who helped victims – including emergency services workers – at the scene of the “horrific” crash.

“My thoughts are with all those injured, and with the friends and family of those who have tragically died,” Allan said on X, formerly known as Twitter, on Monday morning.

The Hepburn shire mayor, Brian Hood, said Daylesford would have been crowded on Sunday, with many people enjoying the warm evening over the unofficial Melbourne Cup long weekend. “This will send shock waves through the community for some time,” he told ABC TV.

The federal infrastructure minister, Catherine King, whose Ballarat electorate includes Daylesford, asked the community to follow advice from emergency services as crews carry out their work.

Five people, including two children, were killed.

They included a 38-year-old man and his 11-year-old son, and a 44-year-old woman and her 30-year-old male partner, along with the woman''s nine-year-old daughter.

At the scene on Monday morning, full jugs, stacks of cups and sunglasses remained untouched on picnic tables where diners had been enjoying the day.

A dog bowl lay on one section of a damaged bench and a shoe could be seen lying on the grass behind police tape as investigators in hazmat suits combed through debris.

Police say the driver, a 66-year-old Macedon man, returned a zero blood-alcohol reading and is expected to be interviewed on Tuesday.

Local businessman Mark Ward was in tears as he sat and watched residents lay tributes at the scene.

"Our community is enormously tight-knit — we are so proud of our town," Mr Ward said.

"For this to happen in such a drastic way, it''s devastating for everyone."

Mr Ward said he had offered his staff the day off to take time to process and grieve.

"A lot of our locals are struggling to cope," he said.

"In fact, I''m struggling to cope."

Known for its mineral springs, spas and regional cuisine, the town swells with tourists during holiday periods.

Assistant Commissioner for Road Policing Glenn Weir told the ABC that all of those who died were tourists who had travelled to Daylesford from Melbourne.

"It should have been, and it was, a great day, the weather was perfect," he said.

"It should have been a great day and it''s ended in absolute tragedy for those who have obviously lost their lives, their family, the injured, but broadly the community of Daylesford, which is one of the great tourism and lifestyle destinations in Victoria.

"It''s just absolutely heartbreaking."

Established in 1916, the Royal Daylesford Hotel is one of the town''s oldest and most popular pubs.

It is situated next to a busy roundabout at the intersection of the town''s main streets.

Victoria Police Chief commissioner Shane Patton said the coroner might look into the safety of the grassy outdoor dining area used by the hotel as part of the investigation into the incident.

"It''s right in the middle of town," Hepburn Shire Mayor Brian Hood said.

"That in itself amplifies the impact.

"Everyone knows the pub, they know the outdoor dining area." 

Longtime local Joanna Parker said she was on her way to get groceries when she saw the shocking scene on Sunday night.

"There were lots of locals that were crying," she said.

"All the girls from the shops that work at the restaurants said, ''We will have to close.''

Chief Commissioner Patton said people raced to help.

"There were numerous people there who selflessly came out and aided those who were dying, who needed first aid," he said.

Rob Green and Michelle Gray were visiting Daylesford for the weekend and considered stopping at the hotel for a drink, but decided against it.

"We saw them sitting out the front at about 3pm … about 60 people," Mr Green said.

"We thought, ''Oh it would be a nice place to stop for a beer.

"It''s horrible — it must be awful for the local community."

Hepburn Shire Deputy Mayor Lesley Hewitt, who lives near the hotel, said there had been a huge outpouring of support.

"My phone has been ringing off the hook, but not just from locals — from people all over the country checking what''s going on," she said.

"It is a tough time and people will need support, and people will need the opportunity to come together and reflect on this, on the loss, on how this could happen."

''Destroyed in an instant''
Local musician Anthony Rodgers said he had planned to play outside the pub on Sunday night.

"I hadn''t been out because of the COVID thing … and I thought I''ll come out and have a sing and I was going to set up near the statue on the grass, sing a few songs, and I got to cutting the grass way late and I didn''t come up," he said.

"But if I had I would have been standing there, and it''s just shocked me."

Mary Chase had travelled to Daylesford for a wedding and was in the hotel with friends waiting to have dinner when the crash occurred.

"We were all taken to the back of the pub and evacuated, and we were taken out, and we already saw white sheets," she said.

"So they were already covering up people."

Ms Chase said it took a few minutes for the gravity of the situation to register.

"More and more police were coming, and then helicopters and then yeah — we started to realise how bad it was," she said.

"We literally walked through that beer garden five minutes before."

Melbourne residents Jenna Acquarola and James Deriu said they were sitting at the crash site an hour before the incident.

"It was a beautiful night," Ms Acquarola said.

"The sun was going down, everyone was enjoying the sun, and it was destroyed in an instant.

Emergency services were called to the scene on Maxwells Avenue, Ashcroft, about 10:50am on Monday, where a grey Ford sedan crashed into a tree and a power pole.

The vehicle split in two and came to rest in the front yard of a house.

The two boys, who were rear passengers in the car, died at the scene. They are yet to be formally identified.

It is alleged the driver and the front-seat passenger — believed to be "young males" — fled the crash scene.

CCTV footage obtained by the ABC shows the moment of the crash before one person emerged from the driver''s seat of the vehicle wreckage.

The person appears to walk across the front lawn to briefly inspect the scene before fleeing.

Police Assistant Commissioner Brett McFadden, from the state''s traffic and highway patrol, said the bystanders witnessed "absolute destruction" and "carnage".

"Anyone that would have witnessed that crash would no doubt be traumatised by it," he said.

Police believe the car was travelling north on Maxwells Avenue "well above" the 50 kilometre per hour speed limit.

Police also want to speak to the rider of a trail bike which was seen travelling on the street at the same time as the crash.

CCTV footage from the scene shows the bike riding on to the grass moments after the crash.

Assistant Commissioner McFadden said it was unclear what, if any, role the bike may have played in the incident but that it was an "active line of investigation".

Search for those who fled scene
Police dogs have been used to scour the bushland near Cabramatta Creek at Magee Street and Maxwells Avenue in the search for those who left the scene.

The assistant commissioner said inquiries into how the crash occurred and the state of the remaining occupants of the car are ongoing.

"They just need to present themselves to a police station so we can engage with them and they can assist us with the inquiries and work out how this tragic situation unfolded," he said.

"The driver is ultimately responsible for themselves, the passengers and the others on the road."

A crime scene was established and the road cordoned off.

The scene will be forensically examined by the crash investigation unit.

Assistant commissioner McFadden said speeding was a "selfish" act that had played a large role in more than 100 deaths this year.

"The community should be outraged and the wider community should take stock that this is a result of speeding," he said.

"She kept saying, ''This is exactly what Josh would have wanted,''" Ms Austin said.

"He''s spreading love everywhere and saving lives, and that''s what he was about."

''Hold your kids tight''
An online fundraiser set up for funeral costs has attracted almost $50,000 in donations.

Friends have set up a small memorial at the crash site, near Josh''s home, and at Ambarvale High School, where Josh was in year 7.

Ms Austin said the family''s main message was to parents and siblings.

"Hold your kids tight, tell your kids you love them every day, siblings tell each other you love them every day," she said.

"Don''t take life for granted."

The family has shared several photos of Josh, but Ms Austin said they were "horrified" by the publication of footage and images of the moment he was hit by the truck.

"It''s extremely disrespectful," she said.

"It''s hard, because the family has seen it — you can imagine?"

Push for safe crossing
Joshua''s death has sparked calls for safety improvements on the single-lane Appin Road, a single-lane road that runs through villages south of Sydney and is frequently used by heavy freight.

Ms Austin said Appin lacked safe road crossings.

"Where the accident happened there''s nothing — literally nothing," she said.

"There''s no pedestrian crossing, no slow-down, the limit is 50 kilometres an hour."

Mr Warren said he would advocate for "a safety review of both vehicular and pedestrian movement in and around Appin".

"Ultimately what we need is a pedestrian crossing and that is going to be a focus for me," he said.');

The Metro Nashville Police Department said the crash happened at approximately 6:45 p.m. on Highway 100 near Harpeth Trace Drive on Friday, Sept. 8. 

A preliminary investigation shows that 23-year-old Alyssa Milligan of Mt. Juliet, was riding with another cyclist on Highway 100 when she was struck by a Ford F-150 pickup truck. 

Authorities reported Milligan was hit by the passenger side of the pickup truck and thrown off her bike. She was taken to Vanderbilt University Medical Center, where she was pronounced dead. 

According to police, the 46-year-old driver of the pickup truck told officers that he saw a cyclist ahead of him on the right side of the roadway. He claimed that as he was attempting to change lanes, he looked over his shoulder, and the cyclist was suddenly in front of him.  

Officials said it appears that the pickup truck failed to yield to the right of way to Milligan. The pickup truck driver reportedly showed no signs of impairment at the scene. 

Authorities said charges are possible pending the conclusion of the investigation into the deadly collision, which remains ongoing.

Three cars, a black Mercedes SUV, a Toyota Echo and a Toyota Rav4, were involved in the incident that occurred on Sadleir Avenue in Heckenberg, near Liverpool, just before 9.30pm.

Police believe "high speed" was a contributing factor and are investigating a person of interest after the occupants of the Mercedes allegedly fled in what''s being described as "abhorrent behaviour".

Paramedics treated 24-year-old Alina Kauffman and her 15-year-old brother, Ernesto Salazer, at the scene but they weren''t able to be revived.

The pair were driving home after the sister picked up her brother from his new job and were just metres away from their house when their car was struck.

About 2pm on Saturday, a 20-year-old man was arrested after he went to Liverpool Police Station. 

The man, who was driving with a disqualified licence, has been charged and will appear before Parramatta Bail Court on Sunday.

He was charged with a number of offences including two counts of dangerous driving occasioning death.

Angelina Kauffman, the mother of two siblings, spoke to media on Saturday about her devastating loss.

"My daughter she''s such a beautiful girl, she loves her brother," Ms Kauffman said.

"And my son he loves his sister. Now my son is gone and my daughter she''s gone. My kids are gone and I have to live the rest of my life with no kids, why? I don''t understand."

According to police, the Mercedes collided head-on with the Toyota Echo occupied by the siblings, before slamming into a stationary Toyota and flipping on its side.

They allege three occupants managed to get out of the rolled car and escaped in another vehicle, a Volkswagen Golf.

"The evidence at this stage suggest the Mercedes crossed to the incorrect side of the road attempting to overtake a car in front of it and has collided head-on with the Toyota Echo," Acting Assistant Commissioner Anthony Boyd said.

"I think it''s abhorrent behaviour. I think the nature of the collision itself is totally unacceptable behaviour.

"And then to flee the scene and not offer assistance to the people in a vehicle, you may have been able to provide some form of first aid which may have assisted in saving their lives."

He said the car had been reported as stolen but its status was under investigation.

Police are also trying to confirm the relationship between the VW Golf and the Mercedes.

Late on Friday, the VW''s 18-year-old driver attended Liverpool Police Station where he was arrested. He has since being released without being charged.

Neighbours, including Parisa Mesri, rushed to the scene to offer assistance after hearing a "loud sound".

"I came out and see that two cars had accident together and people that were inside the small car we tried to help them," Ms Mesri said.

"But we couldn''t do anything because it was very bad. Other neighbours tried to help the boy before the ambulance came."

She said she saw a number of people jump out of a car and assumed they were going to help the victims but "they ran away".

The child died at the scene after being hit by a car whilst out cycling
West Midlands Ambulance Service said a pedestrian who had also been hit by a car near the scene was taken to the Heartlands Hospital with minor injuries.

The death is the third involving a cyclist in Birmingham in as many weeks and the area''s cycling commissioner has called for urgent safety improvements.

Mohammed, who is from the area, told BBC News a pedestrian was struck by a vehicle as he ran to help the 12-year-old and was taken away in an ambulance. He said people did not feel safe on the streets.

"He was trying to show his support and go help him," he said.

"As a result of that he has been injured as well."

He said there had been a few recent incidents with vehicles and pedestrians on the road.

A pedestrian narrowly avoided being struck by a car that went on to into a fence on the same stretch on Tuesday.

"He lost control of the car and hit the fence," Mohammed said.

"It just shows as a community, me, myself as a 16-year-old you don''t feel safe walking around these streets any more.."

West Midlands Cycling Commissioner Adam Tranter, who was appointed in 2021, has called for tougher policing and extra road safety measures from Birmingham City Council after a spate of fatal crashes involving bikes.

''Grim statistics''
Speaking before the latest death, he said collisions happened "with such a regularity that you could be fooled into thinking that this is normal".

"My message is that this is not normal," Mr Tranter said.

The Better Streets for Birmingham group also called for improved safety in a letter published on Twitter on Friday.

It tweeted: "The killing of a child cyclist now puts the grim statistics in our letter out of date. The situation is untenable."

In its letter, the group criticised what it described as a "delay" in delivering road safety measures.

It has also invited people to a vigil on Saturday, at the junction of Belgrave Middleway and Horton Square, where a cyclist died on 16 May.

Jorge said the past three weeks have been nearly impossible. He moved to Middle Tennessee just eight months ago to live with his brother and try to support their family back in Mexico. He’s now having to support them while also paying all their bills here on his own.

“It’s very hard for me financially and also stressful mentally for me because it’s tough,” Jorge said through the translator. “It’s tough for one person.”

Darinel has gone through multiple surgeries, including one to replace five vertebras in his neck, Jorge said. He was on a ventilator and could not move from the chest down.

Jorge drives from their home in Columbia to Nashville every day to visit Darinel at Vanderbilt Hospital.

“He is still not doing well,” Jorge said through the translator. “He is in intensive care. We don’t know when he is going to be out. He is getting better day by day.”

A couple spoke to WSMV how the early morning fender-bender turned into a hit-and-run.

The crash happened on Murfreesboro Pike and Smith Springs Road. A couple driving through an intersection said seconds after being hit, the situation only got worse.

“It all happened out of nowhere,” said driver Courtney Murphy. “It was very traumatic actually.”

Murphy explained as she approached the light at the Murfreesboro Pike and Smith Springs Road intersection, she noticed a car behind her going fast.

As she turned to her boyfriend in the passenger seat to share her concern, Murphy said her body jerked forward.

“As soon as I finished the sentence, he rear-ended us,” Murphy said. “We started to spin a couple of times until I was able to hit the brakes and finally we ended up on the other side of the street this way,” Murphy explained.

When their car came to a screeching halt, Murphy said her boyfriend Justin Johnson jumped out and started documenting on his phone.

“The front of his car was pretty much totaled so he had to get himself together,” Murphy said. “By the time he got out, I realized he was kind of stumbling a little bit.”

Murphy said the other driver and Johnson talked and looked at the cars.

While the couple stood in awe, struggling to communicate with the driver who rear-ended them, something else happened.

Murphy said the guy was getting cold so he ran across the street to get his jacket, however, before he got to his car, another car hits him.

“Another car comes, the white car, and hits him speeding,” Murphy said.

The couple said it all happened so fast.

“It was looking very gruesome,” Johnson said. “It looked very bad for him. He was literally ran over. They whole car went over his body and he still survived.”

In video sent in by Johnson, the car can be seen smashed into the side of the road with the man stuck under the back wheel.

What happened next, Murphy said was heartbreaking.

“The driver took off running and the passenger side gets out of the car and he started to take off running but eventually came back,” Murphy said.

Murphy added that the driver never came back.

While emergency crews rushed the man to a nearby hospital, the couple started praying.

“Regardless of how frustrating it was when he first hit us, he didn’t deserve to be hit by another car. He didn’t deserve that at all. That was just crazy,” Murphy said.

She said she is now paralyzed.

The woman said she was walking out of the leasing office with her mail when her life changed in a matter of seconds.

“When I was in the air, those three seconds, I thought that was it,” Chelsea Stiltner said. “I thought that when I hit the pavement, I am done.”

Stiltner sat in a wheelchair Thursday afternoon. This comes after she said a car hit her in her apartment complex’s parking lot Saturday evening.

“I mean, I can’t go to the bathroom by myself,” the 28-year-old parent said. “I can’t even hold my 2-year-old.”

Stiltner said she went to pick up her mail inside the leasing office. When she stepped out, she said a gust of wind blew it out of her hands.

“I saw a car in the distance,” Stiltner said. “I did like the wave, and I went down to pick up the mail. I heard an engine rev, and by the time I looked up, it was already hitting me.”

Lebanon Police said Stiltner was injured with lacerations to her face and arms and pain throughout her body. Stiltner said after four hours at the hospital, she was discharged. The next day, Stiltner said she had a seizure.

“I can’t feel anything from the knee down and from the knee up, I have 5 to 10 percent mobility,” Stiltner said.

Lebanon Police said there is no video that captured what happened. They also couldn’t find any witnesses or the car and are asking anyone with information to come forward.

Law enforcement’s preliminary investigation revealed that a Holiday Inn Ford Transit passenger van was traveling on West End Avenue in Nashville when it struck Smith, who had begun to walk across the street from north to south.

Smith was walking with his family members, one of which attempted to alert him of the traffic. Smith is believed to have not heard his family’s warning, a document presented to media members stated.

Mid-Town Hills Precinct officers responded to the accident at 10:18 p.m. Smith was transported to Vanderbilt Medical Center where he pronounced dead. Smith was in Nashville to watch Campbell play in the Hawkeyes’ bowl game against the Kentucky Wildcats on Saturday.

“Our hearts are with Jack and his entire family as they grieve the tragic death of their grandfather and father, William Smith Jr.,” Iowa head football coach Kirk Ferentz said in a prepared statement. “We know Mr. Smith was a strong influence on his grandson and a faithful Hawkeye football supporter. All of us – players, coaches, and staff members – will keep the Campbell family in our thoughts and prayers during this profoundly difficult time.”

Iowa Athletics noted in a release that Campbell’s parents waited until after the Music City Bowl to inform him of his grandfather’s death. Campbell’s parents made that decision so he could enjoy his last game as a Hawkeye.

Campbell contributed heavily in Iowa’s 21-0 win over Kentucky at Nissan Stadium Saturday, recording 10 tackles and one sack.

Smith lived in Waterloo, Iowa, and was the father of Jack’s stepmother, Jen Campbell.');

Troopers said there were multiple crashes emergency officials responded to on the Ohio Turnpike eastbound lanes between state route 53 and route 4 in Erie County. The road was closed in both directions Friday.

Eastbound lanes reopened Saturday around 4:40 p.m., according to Turnpike officials, who said Westbound lanes reopened to traffic shortly after 3 p.m. Saturday.

A spokesperson for OSHP tells 13abc the first of a number of crashes happened around 11:45 a.m. near state route 2. Two people were injured with non-life-threatening injuries in a five-car crash, troopers said. The massive pileup happened shortly thereafter when multiple cars crashed around 12:30 p.m.

The pedestrian was struck Saturday evening near TGT Road and Highway 109. He was taken to the hospital with serious injuries and told police the driver did stop briefly before taking off.  

“First of all, just as a decent human being you would want to render aid to someone who needs help,” Police Chief Jason Williams said. “The individual that was struck did have a conversation with the driver of the vehicle who told him that his license was suspended or revoked for failure to pay child support. And so, he didn’t want to call the police for that reason.” 

Chief Williams said it’s never okay to leave the scene of a pedestrian crash and said the driver will likely face additional charges for leaving. 

“It doesn’t help anything because if you hit somebody and it’s an accident, clearly there’s not always charges for that. But if you drive away and you don’t render aid like you should, you don’t notify the police then that becomes an additional issue,” Williams said.  

Police are looking for a dark-colored sedan with damage to the windshield. The suspect is described as a white male in his early 30s around 5-foot-11 with a mustache.  

Chief Williams said the department has already gotten tips from the public and is looking for any more information the community can provide.  

“When they hear about something like this, we have a community that wants to give us information if they have it. So we’ve already received some information from the community that we’re currently following up on,” Chief Williams said. “We don’t like pedestrians being struck by vehicles to begin with, but it’s even more of a concern when somebody does something like this and leaves the scene. We also understand that there’s reasons for everything so we’re interested in those reasons. We’d just like to have a conversation with the individual just so we can bring some closure to this.”');

The chase began in Cool Springs off I-65 South very early Sunday morning, which is when a deputy spotted a car driving well under the speed limit and not maintaining its lane.

When the deputy went to pull over the vehicle, the car sped away.

Within moments, the car was traveling at speeds approaching 120 mph before it eventually entered I-840 westbound.

Before deputies could catch up, the car lost control, going airborne and rolling multiple times.

The passenger, 24-year-old Cory Preston, was ejected and landed many yards away from the smoking vehicle.

Amazingly, the badly-injured man was able to stand and obey an officer’s commands to surrender.

Body cam video shows the officers ordering the obviously injured man down the berm to the side of the road. Once he got to the roadside, he was handcuffed, at that moment, the officer realized how badly hurt he was and immediately called for medics.

The driver, Kevin Cao, was also badly hurt. The collision was so ferocious that he was tossed into the back seat of the crumpled Nissan.

Deputies attempted to break the vehicle glass and open the car, but the metal is too badly mangled.

On body cam video, you hear Cao talk to the deputy and ask if his friend is okay.

While medics attended to Preston, fire crews arrived and used the jaws of life to extricate the injured driver.

Both men were taken to Vanderbilt University Medical Center for treatment.

A large crowd of people were watching the Raleigh Christmas Parade near the North Carolina State Capitol when a white truck pulling a float started drifting.

Glass was arrested and is facing charges that include misdemeanor death by motor vehicle, unsafe movement and carrying a firearm in a parade, according to the release. He is being held at the Wake County Detention Center on a $4,000 bond and has a court appearance scheduled for Monday, according to online records from the Wake County Sheriff’s Office. It is unclear whether Glass has an attorney. North Carolina’s Gov. Roy Cooper also expressed his condolences, saying in a tweet, “In a joyous season on what should be a happy day, we instead mourn for this family and their friends as we keep them in our prayers.” One eyewitness, Justin Kase Conder, told CNN the raised pick-up truck suddenly pulled forward, honked an air horn and “people started screaming.” Multiple witnesses said the white truck lost control. And some people said they heard the driver screaming out of the truck’s window that he couldn’t stop the vehicle, according to WTVD. Raleigh police responded to the incident and both people in the truck were escorted away from the scene and placed in a police vehicle.  The float was carrying some members of the CC & Co.

This morning’s events have devastated us. We also know many of our young ones witnessed this tragedy and that is hard to fathom as well,” the dance company said in a Facebook post.

Just before midnight, police were called to a crash with injuries at the intersection of 19th Street and Chicago Ave. Investigators say 21-year-old Uris Lagunes was traveling east in the 5400 block of 19th Street. The driver of a Hyundai Elantra passenger car, 18-year-old Lexy Vasquez along with three other passengers, were traveling west in the 5400 block of 19th Street.

INSERT INTO articles (id, title, alltext) VALUES (13746, 'The morning of the 100-car pileup: what happened on 6th Ave.?', 'The sky was still dark when Jose Gonzalez drove his black Chevy Silverado toward his job at Deep Rock Water in Five Points. As he headed from his home in Lakewood down 6th Ave., he saw cars turned sideways on the highway.

At first, he was confused, wondering why so many vehicles were pulled over. Then, as he lost control of his truck and crashed, he realized why. There was a pile-up on the icy road before him that he was now a part of.

Another vehicle hit his truck from the side.

“I got T-boned super hard,” he said. “If I was in a [smaller] car, I would have probably been dead.”

Once cars around him stopped slamming into each other, he tried to open his door but couldn’t. So he climbed out of the window and over a couple of cars.

Adrenaline flooded through his body. As he stepped on the ground, he realized his leg could not support his weight. He would learn later at the hospital that his ankle was sprained.

The scene on the three-lane stretch of 6th Ave. around him could’ve been taken from a post-apocalyptic disaster movie. Sedans were turned the wrong way; pickup trucks almost pinned to the concrete border; SUVs strewn about.

In all, about 100 cars were part of the massive wreck that shut down traffic from N. Federal Blvd. to Kalamath St. for several hours. The wreck came on the heels of Denver’s first recorded snowfall, and while the cause of the crash has yet to be determined, the Department of Transportation and Infrastructure said the road was not treated with deicer overnight.

Throughout the morning, tow trucks backed in and out of the collision site on 6th Ave. clearing cars. Street sweeping trucks and city staff had begun cleaning the smashed lights, glass, parts of seats, crushed license plates and bits of metal littering the highway.

One Ford Escape, crushed against another car in front and completely smashed in the back, still had its left tail light blinking as other cars were cleared.

“It looked like just piles and piles of cars on the highway,” said Bradley Pearlman, one of several tow truck drivers who were called to the scene. He arrived around 6:30 a.m.

Another tow truck driver, Lee Duvall, arrived hours before when the pileup was just beginning.

“Nobody knew what was going on,” he said. “We came out here, it went from 10 cars to 20 cars to 100 cars plus.”

Duvall said the road was slippery when he arrived. “It was a sheet of ice. When I jumped out of my truck, I almost broke my neck,” he said.
Though police have not said exactly what caused the accident, several motorists, tow truck drivers and onlookers said the road was icy after the city’s first recorded snowfall of the season.

Denver’s Department of Transportation and Infrastructure said in a statement that it monitored conditions on 6th Ave. after Thursday night’s snowfall. Crews determined at 4:30 a.m. that treating the roads with deicer would not have been effective. Denver Police said it first received a call about the massive crash at 5:40 a.m.

“In Colorado, road conditions can change quickly, which is what happened along 6th Ave creating slick conditions before we had a chance to return to the area,” DOTI said in a statement.

The Fire Department evaluated 83 people on the scene, and transported 13 to the hospital. According to officials, only one person sustained serious injuries. The Fire Department also had to extricate six people trapped in their cars.

Toshia Reyes also drove across 6th Ave early in the morning, but fared better than most of the drivers that followed her.

She made it to her shift at LaMar’s Donuts and Coffee not long before the crash, and considers herself lucky.

“I hit black ice right about the overpass, and then I laid off my gas, got over three lanes so I wouldn’t go into the side rail, got control of my car and started braking,” she said.

Reyes drives over the bridge to work regularly, and said ice on it is not uncommon during colder seasons. “It didn’t surprise me what happened,” she said.

LaMar’s faces the 6th Ave. exit, so Reyes served people trickling in from the scene throughout the morning. At one point, police came in to brief paramedics who had gathered there. One driver who walked in off the highway was starting his birthday in an undesirable fashion.

“I said ‘what do you get for your birthday?''” she recalled. “He said, ‘a new car.''”
A parking lot at Empower Field turned into a de facto wreck yard as tow truck drivers were directed to take totaled and damaged cars there.

Early risers who crashed their cars while heading to work before dawn walked around their cars, inspecting damage. Family members of crash victims snapped photos of the cars. Other people took out whatever boxes, coats and bags they needed to bring home with them.

A woman named Sharon, who declined to share her last name as she was shaken up from the accident, woke up early to enjoy her normal Friday routine — sometime before 6 a.m.

She recalled how, as she drove to her job in the oil and gas industry, she crested the hill on 6th Avenue and saw “a wall of cars in front of me.” She hit the brakes but still slid into some vehicles.

“I sat there hanging onto the steering wheel as other cars kept slamming into me, just bam, bam bam,” she said. She guesses it was just a minute and a half that she sat there, but it felt like an eternity. “I kept thinking, ‘Are any of these cars going to blow?''”

When the “bam, bam, bam” faded further into the distance, she was able to get out of the car and stood with other people, she said. “I just watched and heard the ‘bam, bam, bam” and smoke as far as you could see.”

She was at Empower Field to take photos of her SUV and to report the crash to the insurance company.

Nearby, police, other families and media milled about, as humming tow trucks weaved between them.

As tow truck driver Zay Meha looked around the parking lot, he wondered what had happened to the people in the demolished vehicles.

“That’s a pretty bad accident if your wheel fell off on an SUV,” he said. “That’s scary. No airbags came out, so hopefully they weren’t injured. That’s pretty, pretty sad. I don’t like to see people get hurt, you know?”

This was the first time Meha has experienced the effects of such a large pile-up.

“I mean, there’s a football stadium, and it’s being used like a scrap yard for now,” he said. “It’s crazy.”

Reedah Aritz has been driving a tow truck for about a year.

“When I heard about a 100-car car pile up, I couldn’t take it seriously,” he said. “I thought it was an exaggeration.”

But looking at the cars at the Empower Field lot, he realized it was all too real.

“It can be quite traumatizing,” he said, looking at some of the vehicles that had arrived and imagining the people who had been in them. “We have that car that’s smashed all the way. I mean, who knows what went through their mind when they were just smashed in.” He pointed to another car. “Who knows what went through their mind when their car was just completely disintegrated?”
Given the number of cars involved, the insurance claims will get complicated.

Skyler McKinley, Regional Director of Public Affairs for AAA, said that with such a big crash, figuring out who is at fault and litigating between many different insurance companies will likely take a while. Plus, he said insurance companies are already backed up with claims from the Marshall Fire and with car thefts on the rise.

This means some might have to pay out of pocket up front for repairs, rental cars and new vehicles. Colorado is an at-fault state, so insurance companies can tell their customers to file with the insurance company of the person at fault. But figuring out who those people are given how chaotic Friday morning’s crash was -and pursuing litigation if any are uninsured — will be messy.

“For folks carrying only the bare minimum [insurance] in Colorado, this is an economic catastrophe,” McKinley said.

His advice for people involved in the crash is to document everything, call right away and file as fast as possible.

Gonzalez of the Silverado fortunately does have coverage. He walked around the yard, now on crutches, to inspect the damage on his truck.

Meha the tow truck driver offered him encouragement and to tow his truck to his home.

“I want to get the process going because this kind of ruined my day,” Gonzalez said.

Gonzalez will be able to replace his truck and he has another car to get around town and to work. But he’ll need a few days off from his job at Deep Rock, so he’ll be a bit short on money he needs to get by.

But he’s looking at the biggest positive of the day.

“At least I walked away with my life,” he said.

The 17-year-old boy from Milwaukee was killed in a multi-vehicle crash that closed West Mason and Oneida Streets Sunday night. Police identified him as Cruz Beltron. A GoFundMe has been set up for his family.

According to a Green Bay Police Department report, officers were dispatched at 7:40 p.m. Sunday, Oct. 30 to the 1200 block of West Mason Street to a crash that involved at least three vehicles. Officers say that excessive speed was a factor in the crash.

When officers arrived on the scene, it was discovered that the occupants of one of the involved vehicles fled the scene.

In a newly filed criminal complaint, police identified a suspect in the case as a 15-year-old girl. Police said the driver was taken to the Brown County Juvenile Detention Center on Monday after turning herself in to police.

According to statements in the complaint, the girl had taken her mother''s car without her permission. Prior to the crash, she had spent some time hanging out with friends.

When police interviewed the driver, she was asked how fast did she think she was going and she thought it was not over 55 MPH. When investigators asked the suspect why was she driving so fast and she said that, "she did not know and that she just was."

According to the criminal complaint, police informed the suspect that she was traveling in excess of 100 MPH and she said that she did not think that was right. She also denied using any alcohol or drug prior to the crash.

The criminal complaint says police asked why did she not stop for the red light at the intersection and she stated that she saw that the light was green, but then it turned yellow so she thought she could make it through the intersection.

Police asked why did she not stay at the scene or contact law enforcement. According to the criminal complaint, she said that she did not really know and that she was scared.

Investigators analyzed nearby surveillance video from a local gas station that showed the crash.

According to a statement from a Green Bay Police sergeant in the criminal complaint, the suspect''s car was going about 123 MPH prior to the crash. The posted speed limit in that area is 35 MPH.

Marcus Webster, 19, Swazine Swindle, 17, Kevin Payne, 16, and Ahjanae Harper, 14, were killed when the stolen Kia they were riding in crashed Monday morning, ejecting them and one other passenger, WGRZ reporter Claudine Ewing confirmed Tuesday.

The driver, 16, was treated at the hospital and released, while a fifth passenger, a 14-year-old girl, is listed in good condition at Erie County Medical Center.

In a video shared on Twitter, a local says Harper had recently welcomed a baby girl.

“She was a young mother,” the man remembers. “She definitely spent a lot of time with her daughter.”

Harper was set to celebrate her 15th birthday on Nov. 1. Her family launched a $15,000 GoFundMe in her honor on Tuesday.

Swindle’s sister, Nashira Anderson, told WIBV that the teen enjoyed playing basketball and was known for his goofy personality.

Webster is said to have been a hard worker who juggled school and a job.

The driver of the Kia, which was reported stolen Sunday night, has since been charged with unauthorized use of a vehicle and criminal possession of stolen property. He is due back in court in November.

The teens are believed to have wrecked the car while trying to complete the “Kia challenge,” a TikTok trend that shows viewers how to hot-wire Kias and Hyundais.

Buffalo Police Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia told reporters Monday that law enforcement has seen a spike in car thefts since the challenge went viral. Even so, experts remain skeptical that an online dare can inspire random people to commit an illegal act.

“Isolating a specific video that seems detrimental, and assuming that it has a huge impact over people’s behavior, is just unreasonable from an empirical point of view. That’s not how media effects work,” Yotam Ophir, an assistant professor in the University at Buffalo communication department, told WIBV. 

“Most people don’t know about these challenges, most people don’t care about these challenges, and even if they watch these videos and find them amusing, it doesn’t mean they’re going to walk out and steal a car.”

The investigation into the accident remains ongoing.

“We certainly send our deepest condolences and sympathies to all the families, and everyone impacted by this unfortunate and horrific tragedy,” the Buffalo Public School District stated in the wake of the crash.');

The woman was critically injured from the incident.

Metro Nashville Police Department officials said they issued James Smallwood, of Madison, a citation for failure to yield resulting in bodily injury. The woman was crossing at the intersection of 7th Avenue North when she was struck by the Mitsubishi Lancer. She was transported to Vanderbilt University Medical Center with life-threatening injuries.

Smallwood showed no signs of impairment on scene and was wearing his seatbelt at the time of the crash.

Drivers are supposed to stop for pedestrians crossing in marked crosswalks.

But it doesn''t always happen.

Michelle Beatty and Peter Smith are visiting Nashville from the United Kingdom.

They''re taking in all the sights and sounds of Music City including the traffic.

"Look for the warning lights but you can’t see the warning lights as a pedestrian, so I don’t know if that’s a sign for the driver or for us. But again, the traffic stopped," said Beatty.

It was just a few hours before when this area here looked a lot different.

Crime scene tape and police cars covered the street along James Robertson Parkway and 7th avenue North after a call came in that a woman was hit by a car, critically injured walking through the crosswalk.

"Something to bring more attention and also I think it was dark, pretty dark when it happened too," said Mark Storz who works nearby.

Our cameras caught one person choosing to run across the crosswalk just in case cars decide not to stop.

This woman started to cross but took a step back when she saw no one was going to stop.

"It is tough but you see it every day just cars going by here, so you have got to be extra careful," said Storz.

Tennessee law requires drivers to yield to pedestrians when pedestrians are already walking through the crosswalk.

Tennessee Department of Transportation says there is no requirement in TN for drivers to yield when the pedestrian is about to enter the crosswalk.

For their part, pedestrians must wait to enter the half of the roadway upon which the driver is approaching if it would be “impossible” for the driver to stop.

"When it comes to these crosswalks, I see it all the time, cars just blow past it. It also makes you aware as a walker that you need to be aware as well because they’re not going to pay attention to these signs even though it’s marked pretty well," said Storz.

The crosswalks over James Robertson Pkwy between the Capitol and Bicentennial Mall have flashing beacons, pedestrian scale lighting, and the textured road surfaces to draw drivers attention to these crosswalks.

TDOT does have programs proactively focusing on upgrading the crosswalks with the worst crash history and potential in the state.

“He wasn’t an inmate,” Andrew Tufano told News Center 7′s Molly Koweek. “He was a father. He was a brother.”

>> RELATED: Inmate working on litter crew killed in chain-reaction crash on I-75

The Dayton Post of the Ohio State Highway Patrol is investigating the crash, which involved four vehicles and multiple pedestrians who were picking up litter as part of the Montgomery County Solid Waste Little Program.

A box truck, headed south on I-75 near the exit to state Route 741 in Moraine, struck a stopped county sheriff’s transport van just after 11 a.m. The impact pushed the van into the litter crew. The box truck continued left, across the lanes of I-75 South and hit the center concrete median barrier. There, it was struck by two southbound vehicles.

The worker, identified as 52-year-old Tim Tufano, suffered fatal injuries at the scene.

The other litter crew workers were injured and taken to area hospitals. The driver of one of the southbound vehicles suffered minor injuries and was taken to a hospital. The driver of the box truck and the driver of the other southbound vehicle “claimed possible minor injuries.”

The interstate was closed for approximately five hours.

Tufano had “a little bit” of a drinking problem, Andrew said, which may have been aggravated by the death of a fiancee a few months ago.

“He battled with himself with all of that,” the son said, noting his father was in the Montgomery County Jail on a DUI conviction -- and it wasn’t his first such conviction.

According to Montgomery County online court records, Tim Tufano was serving a 90-day mandatory jail sentence because he violated probation on a charge of operating a vehicle while under the influence (prior felony/under the influence). A second count was dismissed. Judge Mary Katherine Huffman also suspended Tufano’s driver’s license for 10 years as part of his punishment.

Even still, Andrew said his father is to be remembered as a “very firm and stern man” who was a family person and “an amazing dad and grandpa” who taught him how to be a father to his six children.

“When I needed him, he was there,” Andrew said.

As an example, he recalled when Tim Tufano was present and supportive when one of his grandchildren died.

INSERT INTO articles (id, title, alltext) VALUES (13520, '''It was very tragic'' — Week after deadly Lincoln crash, more questions than answers remain', 'Amanda Karr woke up in her Michigan home the morning of Oct. 2 to a Snapchat sent from hundreds of miles away.

The panorama clip from her son Johnathon Kurth, sent the day before, showed “some kind of event place” with a big TV screen, but it was shot so fast it was hard to tell at first where or what he was doing.

It was the Haymarket''s Railyard, Karr would later discover, the same place Cassie Brenner had been hanging out with friends on a Husker gameday before heading out to the bars.

Nick Bisesi had been downtown, too, meeting up with his sister and brother-in-law at a dance club after a day of tailgating with friends and family.

At some point, Brenner, Kurth, Bisesi and three others — Octavias Farr, Jonathan Koch and Ben Lenagh — piled into Kurth’s black 2020 Honda Accord and barreled down Randolph Street, their lives forever linked.

A week later, there are more questions than answers about how and why the car careened off the street east of 56th Street and Cotner Boulevard and into a tree just after 2 a.m. Oct. 2, killing all six occupants in what Lincoln police officials have described as “the worst crash in Lincoln in recent memory.”

“It’s all speculation," Karr said in a phone interview with the Journal Star after she traveled to Lincoln following the crash. "What were they doing over there?"

Five of the victims were from Lincoln, while Lenagh was from Omaha.

Lincoln Police have said little publicly about their investigation into the crash and what led up to it, much of which remains unclear, even to investigators, who were not available for interviews.

“In most crashes we investigate, there’s someone that’s either a witness or involved that we can get some details from,” Capt. Todd Kocian said Wednesday. “Unfortunately, in this case, we do not have that.”

None of the back seat passengers — Bisesi, Lenagh, Koch and Brenner — were buckled in at the time of the crash, police said in the crash report filed Monday. Both Kurth and Farr, the front-seat passenger, were wearing seat belts when the Honda hopped a curb, struck a mailbox and crashed into the tree at an "unknown high rate of speed,” investigators said in the crash report.

Randolph, essentially a minor east-west arterial from between Capitol Parkway and 56th, transitions to a curving neighborhood street east of 56th and dead-ends at Taylor Park, a half-mile from the crash site.

The posted speed limit on Randolph where the crash occurred is 25 mph.

“We’re safe to say speed appears to be a factor in the crash,” Kocian said.

Still, police don’t know exactly how fast the Accord was going, whether drugs or alcohol played a role, whether the driver was distracted or whether the vehicle malfunctioned ahead of the tragic crash.

“These are questions we don’t know the answer to,” Kocian said. “Because, again, we don’t have anybody we can interview. So it’s going to be kind of a battle to figure out exactly what happened. And, quite honestly, we might not know.

“Sometimes you don’t have all the pieces of the puzzle.”

Mo Eisenhauer stayed in that Saturday night but kept up with Brenner, her best friend who was celebrating the Nebraska football team’s victory against Indiana in downtown Lincoln.

“She texted me and she was, like, ‘Hey, are you out?’” Eisenhauer recalled in an interview with the Journal Star. “I told her, ‘No, I didn’t end up going to the Railyard or anything; I stayed at home and watched the game.’

“She was, like, ‘OK, well, I’m at the Railyard now. We’re probably gonna head to bars after.’”


Mourners gather on Randolph Street, which was the scene of a fatal crash that killed six people last week.
KENNETH FERRIERA, Journal Star

Eisenhauer didn’t hear from Brenner again until 12:30 a.m., when the 24-year-old and her roommates — Koch, 22, and Farr, 21 — were at least starting to think about their route home.

“Do you need a way home?" Eisenhauer says she asked Brenner.

“And she was, like, ‘No, I think (Farr) and the others are leaving here soon, so I’ll probably just get an Uber with Octo (Farr) and the rest of the boys.’”

She didn’t.

Instead, the three roommates — along with Bisesi, 22, and Lenagh, 23 — ultimately climbed into the car with Kurth, who Eisenhauer said was an acquaintance of their friend group.

At 2:16 a.m., the Honda smashed into the tree outside Brad Bartak’s home on Randolph Street, where he''s lived since 1971. He used a rock to break the car’s back window and a garden hose to douse a fire emerging from the engine as first responders rushed to the scene, unsure of what they would find.

It was, at first, unclear how many passengers had been in the car, and whether any were in the car when area residents began calling to report the collision, according to archived emergency scanner traffic.

“(Callers) are unable to locate occupants,” a dispatcher said, later adding that bystanders, with their view shielded by the sedan''s curtain airbags, couldn’t tell if there was anyone inside the car at all.

But soon, the devastation became more clear.

“Three or four teenagers in the vehicle,” dispatchers relayed, sending more Lincoln Fire and Rescue responders to the scene, 29 in total.

“They are all unconscious,” a dispatcher said.

Crews extricated the back seat passengers first. Then came Farr. Then Kurth.

Brenner, they said, was the only one still breathing when they reached her. Medics rushed her to a hospital, but the Lincoln woman died late that morning.

The five others died at the scene.

“It hurts," said Misty Goeden, Koch’s aunt who said the 22-year-old was like another son to her. "It hurts to think you’ll never see them again.”

Chris Mannel, a crash reconstructionist who spent 15 years in law enforcement, said "there''s no doubt speed was involved," in a crash of this magnitude.

"You really don''t see those sorts of injuries if you don''t have speed involved," said Mannel, whose company, Nebraska Crash Reconstruction, does consulting work for insurance companies and attorneys while also collecting crash data. "If a car were to hit a building or something else, it would give way ... but a tree, it doesn''t move."

Six killed in crash

Six people died on the morning of Oct. 2 when a sedan crashed into a tree on Randolph Street near 56th in east Lincoln.
Lincoln Journal Star

The car''s airbag module — sometimes called the "black box" — would likely be key to the investigation, especially if there is no video of the crash or witnesses, Mannel said.

The module can provide insight in how fast the car was going in the preceding seconds, but Mannel said it''s possible the box was damaged by either the impact or when the car started on fire.

Investigators could also conduct a crush analysis that can measure the extent of the impact and compare it with data from crash tests, according to Mannel. That could "give you a ballpark figure of how fast they were going," he said.

But some questions may simply be unanswerable.

"Obviously, in the years I was still in law enforcement, that''s what the family wanted — were the reasons and the answers," Mannel said.

Karr said police believe there may be a video of the crash captured by a doorbell camera, but for the most part, details she''s been supplied have been few and far between.

The Eastridge neighborhood in east Lincoln where the crash took place is “nowhere near John’s apartment,” according to his mother, who added that she didn’t know anybody else in the vehicle.

Kurth had moved from western Nebraska to Lincoln to work for BNSF Railway.

“I knew he was trying to put himself out there and meet people,” she said. “He didn’t have family here.”

Kurth would drink on occasion, but Karr said she never saw her son intoxicated.

People gather and lay mementos and flowers Monday at the foot of a tree on Randolph Street, the scene of a fatal crash that killed six people on Oct. 2.
KENNETH FERRIERA, Journal Star

Karr suggested her son may not have been familiar with the complicated intersection where 56th and Randolph streets and Cotner Boulevard converge.

Kurth, she added, may not have known Randolph begins to curve sharply east of 56th, where the ring of bouquets and mementos flanking the crash site continues to grow.

Mourners can be seen contemplating the scene daily, the tree''s stripped bark a bleak reminder of that day and the questions that remain.

“Nobody over there knows what happened, nobody saw it happen,” Goeden said. “They just heard it happen, felt the shakes from the tree. And we just — I guess we’re all just waiting for answers.”');

According to a GoFundMe set up by the boyfriend of Duvraska, the three killed were siblings. Francisco Torres, the creator of the GoFundMe set it up to raise money for their parents to say goodbye to their children. The money would help the mother travel from Venezuela to Nashville and help cover their funeral expenses. Torres said the goal was to raise $36,000.

The accident happened at the overpass on Depot Street around 1:30 p.m. where the car was pushed about 600 yards down the track.

One neighbor saw it all. For more than 20 years Steffon Crutcher said he has lived along the railroad tracks and heard the sound of rattling metal and horns as daily background noise, but what he heard and saw Saturday left him and his son in shock.

“My son and I were watching the game right here in my shed and we just heard a loud bang,” said Crutcher. “It was louder than a normal train going down the track.”

When Crutcher looked out he saw a lot of smoke coming from the train. At first, he thought it was mechanical issues until emergency crews rushed to the tracks.

While troopers say three are dead, Crutcher said this isn’t the first time something like this has happened.

“It has happened since I’ve been here, a couple of times at this particular crossing that I know of,” said Crutcher.

Crutcher said it’s a switching system with no gates and sometimes two trains coming down the tracks at the same time.

“I’ve lived here all my life and the things that I see now just coming through this area right here, it’s a lot busier a lot heavier and there should be something done to make people more aware of the situation with the tracks,” said Crutcher.

A car ahead of the Jeep had stopped at the crosswalk before the collision, according to troopers, and witnesses reported that other northbound and southbound traffic had stopped. A trooper who was on the scene told Reyer that it was very likely the driver did not see the bicyclist enter the crosswalk because of the car stopped in front of her. 

The roadway was closed for about two-and-a-half hours while crews investigated the incident. 

Reyer advised drivers to be very cautious, especially during summer months when more pedestrians, bicyclists and motorcycle riders are out and about. 

“All of them are rather difficult to see because they are not as big as a car and they are a lot more vulnerable because they don’t have that metal cage around them that protects them a little bit better,” he said.');

He said he had never seen anything like it – one minor accident likely caused by the weather turning into a massive, fiery pileup, crushing eight tractor trailers, and taking the lives of three people.

It is understood those injured are a mother in her 20s and three children, the eldest of whom is seven.

All four have been taken to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow but no details about their conditions have been released.

Police said emergency services remained at the scene and local diversions were in place. The A73 is currently closed between Glamis Avenue and Clyde Street.

"The pedestrians are all being conveyed to hospital for treatment.

"Emergency services remain at the scene and local diversions are in place. Anyone with information on the incident can call police on 101, quoting incident 2110 of 27 October."

Melissa Keilloh, 20, was charged with causing the death of 17-year-old Phoebe Johnson while over the drink-drive limit.

The teenage girl''s parents also sobbed as they watched her friend in the courtroom. Keilloh from Hartshorne is accused of being behind the wheel of a red Seat Leon which came off the A514 near Ticknall early on Saturday, October 23, 2021. The car crashed at around 12.30am, killing Miss Johnson, from Swadlincote, and also injuring another 17-year-old girl.

Keilloh sat with her mother for support during the hearing at South Derbyshire Magistrates'' Court and was also joined by other family members. The 20-year-old held back years to confirm her name, date of birth and address and remained silent as details of the accusation against her were read out, Derbyshire Live reports.

The charge alleges that Keilloh, who was 19 at the time of the crash, had been between 97 and 149 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood at the time of the crash, when the legal limit is 80 milligrams.

In a short hearing on Thursday, September 29, Freddie Sail, prosecuting, said: "Unfortunately the circumstances of this collision were that Phoebe Johnson lost her life on October 23, last year. It is a matter that can only be dealt with at the Crown Court. I ask that the charge be sent to the Crown Court. I am content for unconditional bail."

Finn Butler, mitigating, made no representations. District Judge Andrew Meachin granted Keilloh, of Brookdale Road, Hartshorne, unconditional bail and ordered her to appear at Derby Crown Court at 9.30am on Thursday, October 27, 2022.

He said: "This case can only be dealt with at the Crown Court. You must be there on October 27, at 9.30am. If you are late, that is an offence."

The incident closed the A514 between Stanton by Bridge and Ticknall for a number of hours. Debris from the car was found in a walkway next to the road following the incident, with a hole in the hedge left from where the car came off the road.

Following an inquest hearing in November 2 last year, Pheobe''s parents, Nicky and Paul Johnson, said: "Phoebe was loved by many and we would like to thank our family and friends for their support, messages, condolences and love at this very difficult time. The pain is relentless but we have found comfort in the people that knew and loved Phoebe."

Amrit Virk, director of curriculum at Burton and South Derbyshire College, which Miss Johnson attended, said after the crash: "We were incredibly saddened to hear of Phoebe’s passing. She was very well-liked by all of the College students and staff that knew her and we send our sincere condolences to her family and all of her friends."

Dane Wood and his girlfriend were driving to pick up a takeaway when she recorded him in a state of "joyful exuberance" sipping from a gin glass and smiling at the camera. Shortly afterwards he sped through a red light and crashed.

His partner was left slumped in the car and people who came upon the scene thought she was dead. By good fortune, it turned out she only had a broken ankle. As she lay unconscious, Wood posed as a helpful passer-by and denied he had been driving at the time.

Newcastle Crown Court heard the crash happened on the A183 in Sunderland on October 22 last year. Graeme O''Sullivan, prosecuting, said: "The defendant drove his car with one passenger, his partner, at excessive speed. He passed straight through a red traffic light at a junction with a roundabout then crashed into a lamp-post.

"This caused extensive damage to the car. The collision caused an injury to his partner."

The court heard she had to be removed from the car and Wood started pretending he had not been driving. Mr O''Sullivan said: "He was stood by the car and said he had chanced upon the collision and he was not the driver, notwithstanding the fact it was his girlfriend. He repeated the same to the police."

The court heard Wood was over the drink drive limit but he was not charged with excess alcohol in time. Mr O''Sullivan said: "His partner''s mobile phone had footage of him driving with one hand on the wheel with both of them drinking from what appeared to be a gin glass or glasses of alcohol. The footage shows him appearing to hold a gin glass moments before the accident.

Wood, 28, of Rosedale Crescent, Houghton-le-Spring, who has no previous convictions, pleaded guilty to causing serious injury by dangerous driving and was sentenced to 15 months suspended for 18 months with 120 hours unpaid work, a £600 fine and a two year driving ban.

Recorder James Wood QC told him: "You drove at excessive and unlawful speed through a red light at what lay observers thought was 90 to 100mph. You did that with excessive alcohol in your blood but by reason of delay you were not prosecuted for that but I have regard to it.

"You crashed your car into a lamp-post, writing it off and leaving your girlfriend unconscious, with what were thought to be, at the time by those at the scene, catastrophic injuries. In fact, and very luckily for you and her, she only suffered a broken ankle.

"Your partner''s mobile phone was examined and it appears at the time you were driving with a glass of alcohol in one hand, obviously not particularly concentrating on the road. You seem in a state of joyful exuberance with her."

Tony Davis, defending, said the road had a 60mph limit and he was not far in excess of that. He said: "But he accepts by his plea in those circumstances and prevailing conditions it was too fast and that has caused the collision with the lamp-post."

Mr Davis added: "He is a hard-working young man who is providing for four dependants by way of children from his previous relationship, his partner''s children, who he treats as his own and she is about to give birth on October 12.

"He has genuine remorse and this was a brief error of judgement. He went out with his girlfriend to pick up a takeaway meal.

"He was not driving greatly in excess of the legal limit for alcohol. The glass in hand is, frankly, not a good feature of this case. She regrets filming him doing it.

"They decided to pick up the takeaway rather than having it delivered. They went a short distance and it was a silly, stupid error which they have both suffered from."');

According to Orem police, the 20-year old suspect was driving a Jeep Cherokee south on State Street late Oct. 15, traveling 68 mph in a 40 mph zone. When the light at 400 South turned yellow, he accelerated to 73 mph. At the same time, a Chevrolet Malibu traveling in the opposite direction was turning left onto 400 South.

According to witnesses, the Jeep was trying to make it through the intersection before the light turned red. The Jeep slowed slightly, but slammed into the Malibu. The Malibu’s driver was injured, and two passengers inside — BYU students Hailee York, 21, of Lehi, and Ashlyn Hanzon, 21, of Pearland, Texas — were killed.

Both women killed were seniors at the university, a spokesperson confirmed. York was majoring in counseling psychology and special education. Hanzon, who recently studied abroad in London, was majoring in exercise science and wellness.

According to a probable cause statement, police obtained a warrant for the Jeep’s event data recorder. The device indicated that the Jeep was traveling 68 mph shortly before the crash and accelerated to 73 mph when the light turned yellow. The suspect slowed to 67 mph about 0.5 seconds before the collision, the device indicated.

Surveillance video from nearby businesses also showed the Jeep traveling “at a high rate of speed,” according to police.

The suspect was taken to Timpanogos Regional Hospital to be treated for his injuries. According to police, he attempted to flee when officers went to his home to arrest him on Wednesday.

He was booked into the Utah County jail for investigation of negligent homicide, negligent collision, driving without a license, speeding and reckless driving. He is being held without bail.

At BYU, York had formed a group of friends “that were second to none,” which included Hanzon, according to a personal obituary.

In the obituary, York’s family described her as a “peacemaker” who “tried to make sure each member of her family and friend groups were included and loved.” She was a talented musician and athlete who “loved adventure” and was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, serving her faith community in many capacities.

A family member has organized a GoFundMe campaign to help with funeral costs for York.

Hanzon had owned her own photography and videography business for five years, according to her LinkedIn profile. On the website for her business, she said, “Ever since I was young I’ve had a camera in my hand and it’s something I love so much.”

She also enjoyed karaoke, boating, hiking, cycling, traveling, cooking and baking, her LinkedIn profile said.

In a Facebook post, a friend of both York and Hanzon who also attended BYU said, “These two gals got me through my freshman year and were there for me through the hardest moments and the loudest laughs.”');

Carmon appeared to be waiting for a city bus at the intersection of Gallatin Pike South and W. Due West Avenue when he was struck, police said. He died at the scene.

Officer Klingmann was the subject of an Internal Affairs investigation into the fatal crash that occurred on the morning of August 13, 2021 on Kingston Pike near Papermill Drive.

Mauricio Luna, 27, was pulling onto Kingston Pike near Papermill Drive when he was hit by Officer Cody Klingmann, according to a release from KPD Public Information Officer Scott Erland. Representatives with the Tennessee Highway Patrol, who investigated the crash, told WVLT News that Klingmann was not wearing a seatbelt at the time of the collision.

Officer Klingmann had been reassigned from patrol and remained on reassignment until his resignation. At the time of his resignation, a pre-disciplinary hearing was scheduled based on the findings of the internal investigation, officials said.

The mother of a man who was struck and killed is now suing the officer and city of Knoxville for $3 million, according to court documents obtained by WVLT News.

Luna’s mother, Claudia Macias, filed the suit with attorneys T. Scott Jones and Chris Beavers. Macias claimed she’s owed the money to cover funeral expenses and damages for the loss of life, according to the documents.

The court documents alleged that Klingmann was also not using his emergency lights prior to the crash, which occurred around 3 a.m. before the sun had risen. Klingmann was also traveling at 90 miles per hour before slowing to 81 miles per hour at the time of the crash, the documents said.

The filing also alleged that the city of Knoxville was negligent in allowing Klingmann to drive the cruiser, saying they “should have known that he was an unsafe driver.”

Klingmann, who began working with the department in April of 2020, was placed on administrative leave during the investigation.');

Troopers were working to establish a description of the vehicle involved later Tuesday morning.

Tributes have been paid to cyclist Martyn Gall after his “tragic and unfathomable” death while riding.

The 41-year-old was out riding with a club-mate on November 14 in the West Midlands when both riders were hit by a car. 

Martyn died shortly after while the other rider was taken to hospital with life-threatening injuries. 

A woman in her 20s was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and has been released under investigation, the Daily Record reports. 

Cycling group Boldmere Bullets Collective said: “I''m sure many of you will have already heard the tragic and unfathomable news that local cyclist Martyn Gall died after being hit by the driver of a car on the Alvechurch bypass.  

“He was a very experienced cyclist and a stalwart of the Sette Dodici ride - many of us have shared the road with him at some point. Martyn leaves behind a wife and two young daughters as well as many close friends within our local cycling community.  

“I think all of us share feelings of shock, sadness and anger at such an avoidable and meaningless tragedy.” 

The crash happened on the A441 at Alvechurch in Worcestershire at 8am on Saturday, November 14.

Martyn, who worked in transport, was originally from Cumnock in Ayrshire, Scotland, but moved to Birmingham in 2001.

He was husband to Diane and father to two daughters - Heather, 17, and Olivia, 15.

Birmingham bike shop and social enterprise Gear Up said: “Everyone at Gear Up CC would like to send our heartfelt thoughts and prayers to the family and friends of Martyn Gall who has sadly passed away after being hit by a car while out riding this morning with Sette Dodici. 

“Please ride safe and if you are a car driver please please look out for cyclists! We aren’t just cyclists, we are husbands, wives, dads, sons, daughters.”

Juan Tiu-Caxaj, 22, was struck by the driver of a unspecified car on Saturday, Nov. 7 at 1 a.m. as he cycled north on Autumn Avenue, police said on Sunday. The driver was headed westbound on Fulton Street, but, according to police, Tiu-Caxaj “entered the intersection without stopping at the stop sign.”

It is unclear how police determined that. The driver remained on the scene and may, in fact, be the lone witness to the crash.

Tiu-Caxaj was taken to Jamaica Medical Center with head trauma and died on Nov. 14, police said. The Collision Investigation Squad is continuing to investigate, police added. Tiu-Caxaj is the 22nd cyclist to die so far this year, a number that puts the city on pace for a repeat of last year’s bloodiest year for cyclists, when 29 died.

The NYPD announced the latest death on World Day of Remembrance for Road Violence Victims, which honors those who have been killed by drivers and because of poorly designed roads worldwide. In New York, activists with Families for Safe Streets will gather at noon at City Hall for a memorial event.

Tiu-Caxaj’s death was announced on the same day that police reported the death of a Bronx pedestrian. Sonia Sotomayor, 58, was killed by a driver near the intersection of East 180th Street and Southern Boulevard on Saturday at around 7 p.m.

Police released no details except that the driver remained on the scene and was not charged.

Transportation Alternatives Executive Director Danny Harris called both deaths eminently “preventable.”

“With more than 210 people killed in traffic violence so far, 2020 is projected to have the most traffic deaths of any year during Mayor de Blasio’s time in office,” Harris said, adding that both crashes “occurred in parts of the city neglected during Mayor de Blasio’s tenure and Vision Zero program.”

“The location in East New York is a Vision Zero Priority Area, [but] the area lacks the type of protected bike lane infrastructure that has been proven to save lives elsewhere in the city,” Harris said, pointing out that eight of the 22 cyclist fatalities this year occurred in the Bronx. “Yet only three percent of the city’s total protected bike lane mileage is in the Bronx, compared to about 50 percent in Manhattan.”

Harris added:

Rather than fight to save human lives and reverse two years of growing deaths from traffic violence, the mayor has slashed the budgets for life-saving programs like Vision Zero, the Green Wave Plan and delayed the roll-out of the Dangerous Vehicle Abatement Program and the Streets Master Plan. Instead of doing more to save lives, Mayor de Blasio is doing less.

The Department of Transportation is capable of delivering safe streets, but without mayoral leadership that prioritizes human life over the convenience of drivers, New Yorkers will continue to die from traffic violence.');

The driver of the vehicle, identified as 22-year-old Rodrigo Cruz , initially fled the scene but was later taken into custody. The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department called it a “senseless act.” A middle-aged, female cyclist has died after being deliberately struck by a passenger hanging out of the window of a moving vehicle. Both the cyclist and the passenger died at the scene . The act of violence happened around 7:30a.m. Sunday morning in East Las Vegas, along Hollywood Boulevard near Wildcat Way. According to the Las Vegas Review-Journal , the vehicle—a minivan—was driving down Hollywood Boulevard, seemingly racing a few other vehicles. Witnesses reported that the driver of the minivan swerved, and the man in the passenger seat leaned out the window in an attempt to hit two pedestrians, a man and his wife; they saw the van swerve towards them and were able to get out of the way. The driver of the minivan then approached the female cyclist riding in the bike lane, and the passenger leaning out the window collided with her. The cyclist was injured when she fell to the ground and died on the scene, and the passenger fell out of the car. “He traveled along the asphalt for about 150 feet, striking his head on a street light,” Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department homicide lieutenant Ray Spencer said at a press briefing on Sunday afternoon.

Lee Burford, 44, had ignored medical advice and continued to drive his Renault Clio before the tragic incident in Eastcote Road, Ruislip, west London, on October 25 2020.

Twenty-two month old Zhaoxi Wang, known as Xi Xi, died in the crash and her father Qi Wang was injured.

On Thursday, Burford, from Harrow, pleaded guilty to causing her death by dangerous driving and was jailed for four years and two months.

He was handed concurrent sentences for causing injury by dangerous driving and fraudulently failing to declare he suffered from fits to gain employment as a driver in 2017.

The defendant was also disqualified from driving for seven years and one month.

Opening the facts, Catherine Pattison told the Old Bailey: “The tragic nature of the case is perhaps even more significant because had he notified the DVLA of a seizure he suffered four months earlier on June 22 2020, then Mr Burford would not have had a driving licence at all.”

The prosecutor said the defendant had disregarded advice of medics not only about his epilepsy but also non-prescription drugs and had continued to drive regardless.

She said: “It would appear he consumed a quantity of cocaine some time before getting behind the wheel of October 25 2020, the date of the fatal collision.”

The crash happened at about 4.20pm on a stretch of road with a 30mph speed limit.

Mr Wang was pushing his daughter in a pushchair accompanied by his wife on their way home from a park.

Ms Pattison said: “At the time of the collision Zhaoxi was strapped into her pushchair. She was facing forward.”

Burford’s Clio mounted the pavement and struck Mr Wang and the pushchair.

“Mr Wang was thrown sideways towards a low wall and the pushchair was thrown into the air and landed onto the road.”

The vehicle continued on the pavement, hit a telephone exchange box and sign post before coming to a stop in the road, the court heard.

Mr Wang suffered a broken arm and his young daughter’s injuries were too serious and she died at the scene, the court was told.

In a victim impact statement Mr Wang said losing their daughter had been “absolutely devastating for us” and he was left feeling angry and helpless.

He said: “What I would like to say to the defendant is; you should have stayed away from driving.

“You will never know how it feels to be in this situation. To be in our shoes.

Powell, 30, and their 18-month-year-old daughter, Penny, survived the crash on the A40 near Oxford and continue to recover.

In a statement issued through Thames Valley police, Powell said the future was uncertain and there were many battles to come. But he said he had wonderful memories of his wife and three children.

“Before the adventure of starting a family nobody truly knows what to expect,” he said. “All of life’s preconceptions and what we see in the world around us meant that life as a family man was so much better than I expected it to be.

“I had been blessed with four wonderful children, whose thirst for life and hunger of adventure kept me busy but in the best possible way.

“As I look to an uncertain future, I reflect on the fun that we had as a family, with feelings of sadness that it was cut so short.

“Phoebe was my first daughter, and was the model of her mother but with a thirst to always know more. Regularly we would adventure and explore the world together. She was clever and able to make great jumps of imagination – her great creations in Lego are testament to this.

“Simeon was just like his father, with a mischievous sense of humour and desire to know more of the world. A keen sportsman, he had been due to play in first football match this week.

“He shared the kind heart of his sisters and wouldn’t be happier than when he knew that everyone was OK. Amelia was kind and spirited. Her tenderness and thoughtfulness much more advanced than her years.

“Her ability to dance and express herself was a true blessing, with an abundance of self-confidence. Tied down by no element of practicality she had the most vivid dreams and imagination.”

Ms Powell ran two companies and blogged about motherhood while Mr Powell is a railway contractor.

He continued: “Myself and Zoe were as different as we were alike. Despite the frequent tensions this would bring, it was of immense benefit having such differing worldviews.

“Our children benefited from this in having adventures but also the quiet to talk. Zoe was a dreamer. More than anything, we made a great partnership to raise a family.

“I want to thank everyone who has rushed to put their arms around to us to support me and Penny. There are many battles to come, and I thank everyone who has stood by me and Penny thus far.”

Zoe Powell, 29, and Phoebe, eight, Simeon, six, and Amelia, four, were killed in the crash on the A40 near Oxford at about 9.50pm on 12 October last year.

Her husband, Josh Powell, and their youngest child, Penny, aged 18 months, were also passengers in the family’s Subaru people carrier and survived the collision.

Oxford coroner’s court heard the couple had collected their four children, who had been staying with Mr Powell’s parents in Worcestershire, and were returning to their home in Chinnor, Oxfordshire.

Mrs Powell was driving the family car, which had a specialist car seat system attached to allow the four children to sit beside each other on the back seat.

The inquest heard how the crash happened when the Subaru swerved into the path of a fully-laden Renault 480 lorry on the opposite side of the road.

Senior coroner Darren Salter said he could not rule out the possibility this was a deliberate act but he did not consider it likely.

“It’s more likely to be due to fatigue or distraction, or a combination of the two, and that the steering input was driver error,” Salter said.

“The cruise control was engaged and at the last moment the accelerator was pressed instead of the brake, which is a phenomenon sometimes seen in these circumstances.”

He reached a conclusion of road traffic collision for Zoe Powell and the three children, and said their deaths occurred when their car “crashed on to the wrong side of the road and collided with an oncoming lorry”.

Mrs Powell, an artist and author, and Phoebe were pronounced dead at the scene, with the cause of their deaths given as multiple injuries.

Simeon and Amelia were taken to the John Radcliffe hospital in Oxford, where they later died. Simeon’s cause of death was recorded as traumatic brain injuries while Amelia suffered a severe head injury.

In a statement read to the inquest, Mr Powell, a railway engineer, said he had no memory of the crash.

Adao Patricio, who was driving the lorry, described seeing the Subaru approaching on the opposite side of the road before suddenly changing direction and swerving into the lane he was driving on.

“I had nowhere to go. The car came across on to my side of the road very quickly – I don’t know how that could even happen,” Patricio said.

“It was travelling fast but I would not say it was travelling at excess speed. I didn’t have time to brake before the car hit my lorry.”

The inquest heard Penny was thrown out of the car by the impact of the collision and was found crying on the ground by drivers who had stopped after the crash.

In a report, investigating officer PC Lyndsey Blackaby said Penny received first aid at the scene and was later discharged from hospital.

Mr Powell was extracted from the wreckage of the Subaru and spent months in hospital recovering from serious injuries.

An investigation did not find any issues with Patricio’s driving before the collision and there was no clear reason why the Subaru swerved into the path of his lorry, the inquest heard.

The coroner described the incident as tragic and offered his condolences to the families of Zoe Powell and her husband, who attended the hearing.

In a statement issued through Thames Valley police, the families said there was much they would “never fully understand about the crash”.

“The possibility that such a small distraction may have caused such a horrific accident should act as a painful reminder for everyone that roads are dangerous places; the actions of a single moment have wrecked an entire family and had a lasting impact on everyone around them,” they said.

The families described how Mrs Powell, Phoebe, Simeon and Amelia “carried themselves excited by the joy of life”.

“In doing so they have left us with an abundance of happy memories that we can reflect back on fondly,” they said.');

Harry Farley, 21, was killed when his Ford Fiesta left the road and hit the tree off the B2100 Rotherfield Road in Crowborough.

He has today been named by police following the fatal collision on the evening of Saturday, September 26.

In a statement, his family said: “Harry was hardworking, beautiful and kind.

“He was passionately loyal and cared unconditionally for his friends and family.

“He would instinctively protect and come to the aid of anyone or anything in need of help, regardless.

“But most of all he was modest, someone with so many talents that he shared with so few, always choosing to encourage and celebrate others in their own achievements.

“The tributes and memories shared by so many of his wonderful friends are overwhelming and a testimony of the impact he had on those around him.

“Harry was our son, a brother to Charlie and Alfie and a friend to so many. We will always be so very proud of who he was and will miss him always. The space he leaves behind is immeasurable.”

Harry, from Broad Oak in Heathfield, died at the scene of the crash.

Joshua Fletcher, who was 16 years old , died after a collision with a car on the Southern Distributor Road (SDR) in October.

Now, his family has started a petition calling for changes to be made to the stretch of the road where he died.

"A young boy had so much life left but tragically taken," said Avril Fletcher, Joshua''s aunt, who started the petition.

"The family are devastated. I want the council to rethink the road as this is not the first time this has happened. Something needs doing."

Joshua Fletcher died on October 16, after colliding with a Ford Focus outside of the Blaina Wharf pub.

The driver of the Focus, a 28-year-old man from Rhondda Cynon Taf, was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and has since been released under investigation.

Following the incident, calls were made for local leaders, including councillors, the chief constable of Gwent Police, and local politicians, to join together and review accident statistics for the SDR to decide whether action could be taken to make the road safer.

Further calls to review the road were made following another incident nearby on November 2, in which a second teenage boy came off his bike and needed hospital treatment following a collision with a car.

"The road is so dangerous, you would think that after young Josh dying a few weeks ago people would be more careful," said Christine Gulliford, mother of 14-year-old Codi Gulliford who was involved in the latest incident.

Following this incident, a spokesperson for Newport City Council said: "We have a number of projects to further enhance safe cycling and walking routes across the city as part of our active travel programme and want to develop these further to join up the network.

"The police will conduct a thorough investigation into the recent incidents on the SDR. We and the road operator will support them fully in that process.

"When the investigation and legal processes have concluded, the council will work with the police to establish if any further measures need to be considered."


Newport council announced its plans to improve the cycling and walking network across the city back in June.

These include an "active travel project" on Monkey Island, which is located on the opposite side of the River Usk from the spot where both recent incidents took place.

On November 6, the council also announced that it had signed the ''Healthy Travel Charter'', alongside 21 other public sector organisations working across Gwent.

The charter aims to encourage staff to travel in a sustainable way to and from work, including walking, cycling, and the use of public transport.
